Most likely, I do even though over the years I have learned to deal with some aspects.<p>Here are some examples:<p>* I find it extremely hard to concentrate on reading, listening, watching, etc. Just reading a paper or a few pages of book might turn into a multi-hour adventure<p>* The funniest thing is that the same happens when during leisure time when I just watch a movie or listen to music. I constantly distract, skip tracks and multi-task which results in the whole day spent with no completed activities<p>* I have frequent mood swings. That sounds even more like being bypolar but it&#x27;s not that severe<p>Regardless of the above, I managed to be quite successful from the academic perspective, got a master&#x27;s in computer science and mathematics and now work as a software engineer at a large company.<p>That said, I still feel frustrated sometimes by the lack of focus and concentration.<p>What I have been recently practising is using Pomodoro (pomofocus.io) and different background noises (like those on mynoise.net) so that there is no music, no irrelevant browser tabs, etc.<p>As for medications, I have serious doubts regarding stimulants. Based on what I have read, there is no concensus on the long term effect of this class of drugs so that makes me doubt.<p>What is your story?
