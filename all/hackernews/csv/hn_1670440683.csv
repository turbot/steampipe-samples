It’s a personal workflow assistant that was built for devs and their teams to automate non-coding tasks, giving updates and quick actions only on what’s relevant.<p>It works by examining your activity in Jira and GitHub (more systems being added soon) to understand your workflow, creates context out of all that information, and offers you actionable assistance from Slack.<p>Zigi is customiazible. We’re building it to match every R&amp;D persona so you can tailor the messages and assistance you get to meet your specific needs. Like if you’re TL, you can get daily updates on the progress of your team’s sprint or as a QA, you’ll be notified as soon as ticket is ready for testing.<p>We’re developers who are used to managing big R&amp;D teams and over the last few years, we have seen dev change drastically. There’s so much overhead on top of coding, more dependencies, multiple tools, that developers are overloaded. And now, the world has changed to make teams are remote and in different time zones, which just makes everything more complex.<p>Zigi takes a new approach to driving productivity, while keeping devs and their teams happy. It provides hands-on help with personalized automation, so we can manage our day-to-day tasks with minimal distractions and maximum focus.<p>Some things to know about Zigi: you don’t need to set it up or run any config; it’s customizable to your needs; it only needs user-level permissions and doesn&#x27;t read or scan your code; it’s ISO 27001&#x2F;27017 &amp; Soc 2 Type 2 certified and GDPR compliant.<p>It’s also free for devs.<p>Sign up to get started here.

A little while ago I had to do an image edit that was fairly simple but too complex for Preview. As someone who isn&#x27;t great at Photoshop, I turned to ImageMagick. But then I had to figure out the correct ImageMagick command and get ImageMagick installed on my laptop. In total, a simple image edit took about 30 minutes.<p>I made ImageCalc to make that easier. It uses GPT-3 to turn a plain text description into an ImageMagick command, and then WASM[1] to run ImageMagick in the browser (so your image never leaves your device). Here&#x27;s a quick demo of what it can do: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0u3sXqgh3A8<p>It doesn&#x27;t work 100% of the time, but it&#x27;s so quick to try that I&#x27;ve already found myself reaching for ImageCalc before anything else. It&#x27;s especially helpful if you want to figure out the right command for a web service or batch command.<p>Hope you find it useful!

Just wanted to share the story of bringing it to fruition here on hn.<p>I started out spending a couple days trying to get something cross-platform going in Flutter, but it soon became clear that wasn&#x27;t the best fit, seeing as I&#x27;d need native hooks for most of what the app needed to do, and it wasn&#x27;t yet clear it&#x27;d be possible at all. So I switched to making it an iOS app in Swift. The accelerometer data turned out to be not nearly accurate enough to do the job, so I switched to using the camera&#x2F;AR using ARKit... and it worked instantly. Like the very first time I hooked up a slider UI element to the distance function. It felt a bit like magic. And also just ridiculous.<p>Here&#x27;s a video I recorded to send to some friends at the time:

But I thought I&#x27;d share in case anyone is interested in watchOS, or in general, wants Apple to spend more time fixing their broken App Store review process.<p>The short summary is the reviewers who review watchOS app don&#x27;t even look at the watchOS app. That may sound unbelievable, but it&#x27;s true. My app has paying customer ($19.99 In-App Purchases with 5 star review average) who paid to see content on watchOS, but the content is controlled with the companion iOS app. I submit big fix updates, the reviewers only look at iOS, don&#x27;t see the content they expect ,and reject me.<p>If this happened once or twice, I wouldnt&#x27; mind. If it happened, and then I explained that they needed to look at the watchOS content, I wouldn&#x27;t mind. Instead, I repeatedly explain it, they repeatedly ignore my messages, and copy-paste rejection reasons that have no applicability to my app, such as telling me to add a demo sign-in credentials even though my app has no sign-in at all.<p>They communicate very poorly, with copy-paste responses, and the few times they&#x27;ve sent screenshots only highlight how little diligence they&#x27;re investing into the review because it clarifies they haven&#x27;t looked at the watchOS app at all.<p>Every single one of these cycles takes 24-48 hours for Apple to respond meaning bug fixes for paying customers are blocked for over a week.<p>My app clearly explains what it does in its description which is why I have sales and a 5-star average review. It&#x27;s only the reviewers who are confused, not customers.<p>I spent $99.99 to be part of their developers program and I have customers spending $19.99 on In-App Purchases for watchOS and bug fixes are being blocked by reviewers who very clearly never looked at the watchOS app.<p>I already went through the appeal process once, and got the review overturned. marketed it in a niche subreddit, had users spend $19.99 on IAP, had the users report some bug fixes, I want to get those bugs fixed.<p>I thought after the initial appeal, that would be the end of this discussion and reviewers would understand my app going forward. Instead I&#x27;m getting the exact same feedback that they don&#x27;t see the IAP content and they are sending me screenshots of my app. Ironically they highlighted an area right above big, bold text I added that says &quot; THE CONTENT IS ON THE WATCHOS APP&quot;.<p>I added that big annoying message, not for any of my paying customers, but for the App Store reviewers.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m considering adding stub iOS content just to assuage the reviewers. But it&#x27;s annoying that I have to build features out for reviewers rather than paying customers.<p>There&#x27;s a &#x2F;rant asect to this post but I also know that sometimes ranting on social media helps give visibility to issues with bad customer service and bad developer relations so I thought I&#x27;d take a shot.<p>I have a lot of watchOS ideas I was excited for but I&#x27;m realizing it&#x27;s going to be a waste of time and money to invest in watchOS dev if Apple refuses to give Apple Watch apps fair app reviews.<p>I really hope Apple takes a closer look at their review process and fixes it for paying developer programs members like myself my customers who spent $19.99 on IAP, for which Apple takes 30%.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
