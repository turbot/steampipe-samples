Lately I&#x27;ve been seeing so many cool job openings for people who, like me, like to do both design and development (e.g. Product Engineering).<p>Although it&#x27;s exciting to see more and more companies hiring for these positions, I often struggled to find job openings about it. I&#x27;ve noticed that many companies use different names to call this role, like:<p>• Product &#x2F; Design &#x2F; UI engineer<p>• Designer Technologists<p>• Developers who design<p>• ...<p>I&#x27;ve decided to create a website to collect all these openings! I hope this can be useful to more people working in this space :)  It would be great to get some community support in finding other similar positions.

35408817,Ask HN: How do you do slow migration with zero downtime?,2023-04-02T09:44:01Z,edweis,2,false,false,2,"[35409002,35408906]",,,,"Hi HN,
We have non-relational databases (Elasticsearch &amp; DynamoDb) that require data migrations ranging from 1h to 20h to be run every once every ~10 days.<p>In the past we used migrations scripts such as db-migrate (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;db-migrate) that would run in the CI newly created scripts. However it became clear that when the migration is long, the cost is huge.<p>We transition to using a dedicated server for migrations. However not having the migrations errors in the CI is troublesome as there is not a single place to check the deployment status, hence reducing the developer&#x27;s ownership of the migration. We had more migration errors, and we almost hired a DevOps engineer to monitor data migrations.<p>We move to use a 4-step migration process to migrate the database from state OLD to NEW:
1. Create NEW schema (=create a new field, index, or partition key) that co-exists with the OLD schema. Also write to both NEW and OLD schema.
2. Run the data migration to populate the NEW schema (it is the step that can take from 1h to 20h)
3. Move the read from OLD to NEW (this can be done slowly from 1% of users to 100% if necessary, and revert is easy)
4. (optional) Remove OLD schema to clean out the database<p>The 4-step migration is great, developers can do 1, 3, 4 with PRs and 2 is ran on our migration server. However it is still a process that needs to be tough, learnt, and applied. There may be better practices and better third parties to do this.<p>How do you manage data migration in your organization?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35408766,Show HN: Integrating puzzle rush and spaced repetitions for chess training,2023-04-02T09:36:21Z,danmaz74,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN! I’m publicly releasing BraiMax Chess, a web app I built during the last three months; it’s based on a training technique which brought me from around 1700&#x2F;1800 to 2000 rating (superblitz) on lichess. Here it is: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chess.braimax.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chess.braimax.com</a><p>Background story: during lockdown I decided to try and improve at chess, which I was playing online a lot. Bought a few books, tried all the websites and apps I found. This serious study helped a lot in understanding the game better, but didn’t improve my results as much as I hoped. It also was very hard work, and after a few months I stopped having the motivation to continue.<p>Around that time I discovered Puzzle Rush on chess.com; that one was the most enjoyable chess-related thing I could do besides playing games, and it helped with tactics, but I soon plateaued - until I thought about combining that with spaced repetitions. I would manually review the puzzles I had failed, and add them to a rudimentary spaced repetitions system I had hacked together. It was a bit of work, but still enjoyable enough to stick to it; that’s when I started getting noticeably better and better, making fewer blunders, and climbing the rating.<p>Late last year I decided to take some time off after leaving my last job; during the break I felt an itch and decided to create a website which would allow anybody to use the same technique I described above, but in a much easier&#x2F;integrated way. After three months of full time work on it, it’s ready!<p>Let me know what you think<p>Dan",story,https://chess.braimax.com/play/puzzle_rush,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
