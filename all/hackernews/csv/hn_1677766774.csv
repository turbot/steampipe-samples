We will be announcing many more activities throughout this month.<p>I have been part of the organiser team for 3 years now. It is completely volunteer driven. It was though to get through COVID as we highly appreciate the in-person culture. Incredibly grateful to be back again!<p>I am merely sharing because we tend to get a bit limited to the nordic countries (no wonder!), but we had quite a few participants from other countries who loved coming and getting a sneak peek into how the Nordic games industry looks.",story,https://nordicgamejam.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

To give you more context, the Audience builder in Castled allows non-technical folks to create user segments on the data warehouse without using SQL and without involving data engineers.<p>Now, this concept is nothing new. Existing Reverse ETL solutions already provide this capability, but the problem is that the feature is available only in their expensive &quot;enterprise&quot; package. This makes it difficult for an average marketer or product manager to leverage this capability.<p>Today, we are excited to announce that we are making our Audience Builder available as a standalone product - Castled Audiences. With Audiences, you can create custom user segments in your warehouse and send them to a destination of your choice. Also, this feature is available in our Starter package - no hidden conditions applicable. The cost is the same if you are sending it to 1 destination or 20. Here is a demo:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;4e10b4e80c8b43efbb29e2c287d35744<p>Feel free to email me at frank@castled.io, if you want to give it a try.
