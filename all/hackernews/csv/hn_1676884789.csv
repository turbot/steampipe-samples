A rock band steps up to save the world.<p>After I wrote this and put it on my website, I had a huge number of hits from .gov and .mil sites that mapped to Virginia and a ton of hits from IPs in Iraq. About a week after, I came home and my neighbor told me the police were going through my trash cans. A couple days later, they shined spotlights through my window while I was in my place watching a movie with friends. A few days after that, my apartment was broken into and they left my shotgun, my cash and gold lying out, and took my laptop. The police came and decided it wasn&#x27;t a normal burglary. My girlfriend and I moved to a motel, never slept there again, and fled the country the next week. We stayed out for 10 years.<p>It&#x27;s not the greatest book but it&#x27;s kind of ahead of its time in certain ways.",story,https://joshstrike.com/amap/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
