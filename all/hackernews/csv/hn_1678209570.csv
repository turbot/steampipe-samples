A few days ago I saw a graph[0] that showed the # of job postings on HN was declining. I started wondering what other trends I could glean from the data, so I created this!<p>You can filter through the top level comments by keyword; for example you can filter by &quot;remote&quot; to see the massive spike around March 2020. Another interesting thing I found is that I can compare hiring across cities.<p>I hope you enjoy! I made it so that the links to your search are sharable so if you have some interesting data you should be able to just link the page you&#x27;re on!<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rinzewind.org&#x2F;blog-en&#x2F;2023&#x2F;the-tech-downturn-seen-through-hacker-news-comments.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rinzewind.org&#x2F;blog-en&#x2F;2023&#x2F;the-tech-downturn-seen-th...</a>",story,https://www.hnhiringtrends.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
