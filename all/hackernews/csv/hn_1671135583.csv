I code, I ship, the features I&#x27;ve worked on and led development on are now in the hands of millions of users. Unfortunately I was recently laid off, not due to performance issues. My whole team was deleted, and I understand the motivations for it, it is what it is.<p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve had an uncomfortably high interview failure rate despite my successes. I&#x27;ve only had success because my resume looks great; when I ship I do it well.<p>But I succeeded in getting my last job because I passed one out of 7 interviews. The more I talk to my peers as I&#x27;ve moved up in the tech world I&#x27;ve learned they do not have similarly high failure rates. They often have competing offers.<p>I am comfortable when secure in my job. Comfortable timing myself in Leetcode. My brain connects the dots. I take steps and decide which steps to take from there. Easy, because I can build the model&#x2F;graph in my head, I am maintaining useful state.<p><i>But when I have to be face-to-face with someone who is judging me, who is determining my salary, etc, and I fall apart.</i> I can barely contain my physical discomfort. Super obvious basic problems become complete mysteries, as my brain empties out all useful state, and I&#x27;m therefore unable to make connections without repeating the problem or concern multiple times. And because of this I&#x27;m very very slow. So slow that it is common feedback from interviewers, something that indicates to them I&#x27;m not senior enough.<p>The only common detail about all my successful interviews that was that the interviewer was super kind and I was able to maintain some confidence in my actions.<p>I also end up making the most absurd mistakes. Typing-variable-declarations-wrong level problems, and I&#x27;m utterly confused when they happen. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m in fight-or-flight mode and I&#x27;m just making decisions, to make any progress at all, to get to the end of the stressful interview, but I make those decisions before I&#x27;m conscious of them, so it&#x27;s a self-defeating loop.<p>I&#x27;ve watched my laid off teammates get positions at Google&#x2F;Meta&#x2F;etc, and I know I can&#x27;t pass those interviews (I bombed the Meta coding sessions a few years ago). My anxiety is worse than ever now, as I am solidly without a job. I feel confident I can go work for a bank and be anonymous, there&#x27;s plenty of jobs out there. But I want to be at the Big Names, and part of that is passing these types of interviews.<p>How have others resolved the particular problem of performance anxiety, being graded, etc? What steps have you taken, where have you succeeded, etc.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
