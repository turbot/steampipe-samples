35414388,Show HN: Tramline – release cycle coordination platform just for mobile apps,2023-04-02T19:49:02Z,prxtl,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN! We&#x27;re super excited to open sign-ups for Tramline, an open-source release engineering platform built specifically for mobile app teams.<p>The team behind Tramline has spent a decade working on: 1&#x2F; some of the biggest mobile apps in India and SE Asia, and 2&#x2F; backend and API systems to support many of those same apps. It is clear to us that the status quo of release engineering for mobile apps is nowhere close to what backend and frontend web engineers are used to. Mobile teams work within the constraints of not just mobile devices, but also the rules of App Store and Play Store and the kind of release engineering they enable.<p>For mobile teams at scale, workflows on a CI server simply aren&#x27;t enough to release updates to the stores with confidence. Teams need to coordinate across multiple kinds of systems (app stores, CI servers, internal&#x2F;external build distribution systems, observability platforms) which means that a mobile app&#x27;s release cycle touches all these systems. Elite mobile teams at places like Facebook [1] and Shopify [2] have been working on these areas for years.<p>With Tramline, teams can codify their mobile release cycle across different systems, and rely on a central dashboard to manage their releases. Check out our 4-minute overview video! [3]<p>Excited to get some feedback and answer any questions!
