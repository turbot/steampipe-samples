As someone with severe ADHD, I find technical interviews to be a significant challenge, even though I am confident in my abilities to perform the work that is needed and expected.<p>Recently, I had a conversation with a former technical recruiter who suggested requesting accommodations for my disability during interviews. I am reaching out to the community to ask if anyone has ever made such a request and what their experience was like.<p>In my case, the rapid-fire nature of technical interviews often leaves me feeling flustered and unable to effectively answer questions. I know that my brain functions differently, but I am eager to find ways to overcome these limitations and showcase my skills and abilities in the interview process.<p>I would greatly appreciate any thoughts, considerations, and criticism on this topic.

We’ve been building a new browser-based design tool that’s ready for you to play with!<p>My cofounder David and I were previously on the Design Tools team at Airbnb, where we built lots of innovative tools to improve the design process internally. Now we’re trying to bring this caliber of tools to everyone.<p>The first problem we’re trying to solve is the age-old problem of working in low fidelity vs. high fidelity when designing UI. Low fidelity wireframes are great for quick iteration while hashing out the main idea, while high fidelity mockups and prototypes are often better for conveying the idea to teammates or pitching the idea to customers.<p>With Noya, you get to work in low fidelity, while still getting a high fidelity output you can share. Noya does this by converting your low fidelity blocks into high fidelity design system &amp; React components.<p>I think of the current version as an MVP still, since there’s a lot more that I want to add, but I’ve personally been finding it useful even with its limited feature set. I’d be very interested in any early feedback if you have a chance to play with it!<p>PS: We’ve open sourced most of Noya at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noya-app&#x2F;noya"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noya-app&#x2F;noya</a>.
