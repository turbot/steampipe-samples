Simultaneously, Semut enables developers to contribute to open source projects full-time without worrying about a pay check.<p>A developer can build a managed service using Semut in matter of weeks instead of months or years it would otherwise take.<p>We are thrilled to show what we have building and see how our technologies will get used.
