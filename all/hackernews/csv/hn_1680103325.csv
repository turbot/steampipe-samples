35358535,Show HN: Mirrorful – A developer-first way to implement designs faster,2023-03-29T15:19:24Z,teddarific,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN! Mirrorful (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mirrorful.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mirrorful.com&#x2F;</a>) is an open-source developer framework that helps front-end engineers manage their design systems. We’ve been building Mirrorful with the open-source community (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Mirrorful&#x2F;mirrorful"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Mirrorful&#x2F;mirrorful</a>) and wanted to share our beta with you. Check out our online demo to get the idea: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mirrorful.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mirrorful.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>Design systems can be thought of as the “building blocks of your app” which makes me think of Lego bricks. Mirrorful helps you manage your codebase’s Lego bricks and ensure that they are consistent across all of your apps and platforms.<p>We saw as product engineers how hard it is to get code to match Figma mock ups. High-quality design is a competitive advantage, so getting your UI pixel perfect can matter a lot, but is time-consuming and tedious.<p>When we worked for large public companies, we saw that good component libraries help, but engineers are often still dealing with tweaking small design decisions. There are a lot of inefficiencies. We also worked at a small startup and saw what it was like to not have a design system. No design system led to copy pasta code, and days of back-and-forth on simple things like “what hex should i be using for the hover state?”<p>Design systems are tricky to get right. Picking an out-of-the-box solution is easy to begin with, but one day you’ll be cursing yourself due to lack of flexibility (we did!). On the other hand, creating a design system from scratch is super time-consuming even for the best frontend engineers. Mirrorful is our way out of this dilemma.<p>Mirrorful is completely open-source and written in Typescript. We’re starting with basic design elements—commonly called “design tokens” — such as colors, typography, and shadows, but have plans to expand our scope into more complex components.<p>As frontend engineers ourselves, we wanted a tool that lives in code but is visual. It had to be super easy to set up, but also prepare you for scale so you and&#x2F;or your team don’t end up copy-pasting everywhere. We decided to make it an NPM package (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;mirrorful"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;mirrorful</a>) that runs a localhost editor and exports out your design tokens into any configuration you want: .js, .ts, .css, .scss, .json. It’s lightweight with no design system lock-in.<p>Our product is completely self-serve: just install our NPM package. If you run Mirrorful locally, a visual dashboard will pop up at localhost:5050 that lets you manage your theme and export various configuration files directly into code.<p>Pricing is similar to other open-source companies—we charge for cloud-hosted features and for premium components.<p>We’ve built open-source&#x2F;open-core projects before and love interacting with contributors from all over the world. If anyone has any opinions on what we’re building, we’re all ears. Check us out at mirrorful.com and at github.com&#x2F;Mirrorful&#x2F;mirrorful and give it a shot!",story,https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We helped thousands of deserving men and women land jobs, but when the pandemic hit in force, it destroyed our business.<p>Several months ago I announced with great sadness that I was ceasing operations. Both the HN and Y Comb. (I was in S17) were incredibly supportive. I&#x27;ll never forget that.<p>But I&#x27;m not done with my work. Like most, I&#x27;m amazed at the potential of AI. I know that employing it to help people with records land jobs would be enormously effective, so I am planning to launch a new company, SecondChance AI.<p>Most of the people coming out of prison have no clue on how to land a job; how to create a resume and cover letter, where to look, how to apply, etc. And that&#x27;s assuming they have the most basic of tech skills--which many don&#x27;t.<p>If that wasn&#x27;t challenging enough, nearly all employer HR departments have internal parameters for who they can and cannot consider, based on criminal records. Unfortunately, they generally don&#x27;t share this information, so we have job seekers applying to jobs they can never land, and HR departments assessing candidates that they can never hire (they only know this after getting a background check, which happens at the very end of the assessment process).<p>What if jobseekers (and there are 70 million Americans--1 in 3 adults) with records could access an app powered by AI that would create the resume, cover letter, search for available jots (most importantly, those that would accommodate their record) and apply on their behalf?<p>Obviously a great service to job seekers, but to employers as well--saving them time and money.<p>I think this would be very fundable and would scale very well.<p>I&#x27;m considered a national expert on reentry, and I certainly know how both sides of this marketplace work. I&#x27;m seeking a co-founder and&#x2F;or CTO&#x2F;tech lead to work with me on this.<p>I can&#x27;t begin to describe how gratifying this work is.

35358384,Ask HN: Should open source projects track you?,2023-03-29T15:10:12Z,andreacavagna,2,false,false,1,[35358513],,,,"Hello everyone, I&#x27;m the maintainer of an open-source DeveloperTool (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Noovolari&#x2F;leapp)<p>With a heuristic of 7000 users daily, I started feeling the need to have more information on how Users are using the project to improve it.<p>Is it the right thing to do to create a better Developer Experience and gain feedback for the end users?<p>On a side: 
&quot;it&#x27;s acceptable for open source software not to work is a great thing. This makes it easy for anyone to contribute because there are no hurdles from what your work must include or not include - it&#x27;s up to you. Mistakes, or half-baked projects included. You can&#x27;t have innovation without a lot of people being able to contribute and make mistakes, or give up.&quot;<p>As pointed out in the PostHog article below, I extracted some important passage:<p>&quot;From a utilitarian perspective, We believe that tracking the minimum data possible to build useful technology, in a way that doesn&#x27;t share that data with 3rd parties, means that you have the right approach to product analytics in your open source project.&quot;<p>In most cases tracking user data to enrich functionalities means you have to deal with an opt-out&#x2F;opt-in setting (like VSCode does) to get data to the open-source project&#x27;s maintainers; developers are the most sensitive people regarding data.<p>I&#x27;ve never added this tracking on the Desktop App since I&#x27;m worried about the community&#x27;s reaction. And this is a direct message to them.<p>Is it right to have people helping the growth of the open-source project by tracking only fewer data to improve stability and functionality?<p>&quot;All tracking is bad, many say. We disagree. Done right, it enables more and better software in the world. When it&#x27;s applied to open source, it often enables more free software for anyone to use.&quot;<p>P.S. I&#x27;m not yet a user of PostHog, but I want to congrats with them on the article, and the best way (if it is a good thing) to track open-source data is to do it with an open-source project too.<p>All the references are from the below blog post.
