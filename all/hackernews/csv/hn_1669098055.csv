These days I&#x27;m looking into building my own applications with Spring and Kotlin. Firebase doesn&#x27;t fix my problems of data integrity hence I&#x27;ve coded the backend of my app too (which is sad considering how promising Firebase was)<p>I&#x27;m trying to find a way to deploy my servers. Currently I&#x27;m running my production and staging servers as two Hetzner instances running docker-compose stacks. But I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s not a good solution since docker-compose can&#x27;t really create a development environment as a copy of production (I don&#x27;t know why this is bad.)<p>I&#x27;ve looked into Kubernetes but if you&#x27;re not paying to someone to manage it for you (for example DigitalOcean or Amazon EKS) it&#x27;s incredibly complex. Also if you chose to use a cloud provider to manage it for you every load balancer adds another item to the bill. I&#x27;m running a 3 node cluster on DigitalOcean now but it&#x27;s too complex to even deploy a container to it.<p>So what are your thought on how a lone developer should deploy their APIs to production and staging?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Could you suggest books&#x2F;blogs or people to follow on youtube or other social media that can help me to learn about vertical farming?
