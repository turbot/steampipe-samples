Been a while since I&#x27;ve posted and in the time since I have created a trading journal website where you can submit and track your trades with the USP of tracking your outgoings too.

I want to help people do that!<p>It&#x27;s still in very early stages and I&#x27;m releasing new updates daily but would be very grateful to get some other peoples feedback!<p>Thanks in advance and hope you&#x27;re all having a good day! :D",story,https://trackyourtrades.co.uk/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Some friction points I have discovered and would like to address:<p>- Maintainers already have mature code and are far up the mountain of domain expertise. Playing catchup is hard.<p>- Open work is either too trivial, picked up too quickly by maintainers, or not documented. The, &quot;I wish I had an idea for a feature I could contribute in the first place&quot; problem.<p>- Medium plus sized projects require lots of domain knowledge, which means a new contributor will be slow. Often not able to ask many dumb questions to busy maintainers to unblock oneself.<p>- Putting work out into the public and getting scrutinized by old time maintainers can be daunting.<p>I&#x27;m asking, because I&#x27;ve realized that the only time I&#x27;ve successfully onboarded onto a large project has been with physical proximity to a developer and hand holding as I joined a new team driven by corporate interests. I&#x27;m interested in learning how to tackle the hard mode of making this jump into maintainership in open source.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
