(some are extremely evil, like stopping <i>half</i> the internet 128.0.0.0&#x2F;1 or 0.0.0.0&#x2F;1 every 10 minutes for 3 seconds)<p>I made a whole deck of cards (each prank fits on one playing card): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jackdoe&#x2F;programming-for-kids&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;projects&#x2F;panic&#x2F;cards-small.pdf<p>I sell the decks for 5€ (e.g.: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;punkx.org&#x2F;c-pointer-game&#x2F; or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;punkx.org&#x2F;punk0&#x2F;) but for this one, I am not even sure what kind of lawyer should I talk to, to make sure I am not liable if a user of the deck damages someone&#x27;s computer. I also aded epilepsy warning on the cards that are very visual (like randomly rotating the screen 90 degrees).<p>The deck is also licensed CC BY 4.0, so anyone can re-print it, and are the people printing it and sharing it liable as well? The warning I have now is made by me and you can see it on the first card, but I will also paste it here:<p><pre><code>    WARNING! WARING! WARNING!

Any advice will be super helpful, I really think the pranks are very fun and educational if used properly, but like any prank it can go too far.<p>Thanks in advance.<p>EDIT:

34985037,Ask HN: LastPass Legal Liability,2023-03-01T17:17:30Z,Ghostt8117,1,false,false,,,,,,"I pay for LastPass premium and after months they have finally acknowledged the extent of their breach and their recommended steps to protect yourself. These steps include: updating algorithm security, changing passwords, changing master password, and resetting MFA. Basically, they have completely failed to do the only thing I pay them to do, and they continue to use the lowest recommended algorithm by OWASP for encrypting passwords. I do not have the finances to hire a lawyer and I would like to know if there are any legal steps I can take for remediation? Personal or class action or arbitration? I understand that responses are not legal advice - I am seeking recommendations for what legal advice to seek.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
