35068594,Show HN: I made a guided copywriting AI tool,2023-03-08T13:16:02Z,akuji1993,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey Hackernews<p>I&#x27;m Tobias, ux software engineer by day and indie hacker by night. The last months I invested a lot of time getting the hang of chatGPT and its predecessor GPT-2&#x2F;GPT-3.<p>Based on that knowledge and how to create the best prompts, I created a small copywriting ai tool called schreiberling.app (scribbler in english I guess). The special thing: The user isn&#x27;t left alone with creating their product copy, they&#x27;re asked a round of questions to get a better hang of what their product is and who it is for.<p>This also prompt the user to think more about their product and who their perfect customer actually is. Great for products that haven&#x27;t launched yet or are not final in their product market fit.<p>Right now I launched my Beta v2 release, that now uses chatGPT API instead of GPT-3 (davinci), since openAI released the chatGPT api last week.<p>Some learning going from v1 to v2:<p>- People didn&#x27;t know how to provide information without guided questions 
- Prompt engineering for multiple languages forced me to create multiple prompts, one for each language
- I created somewhat of a prompt engine to handle things like language, but also things like &quot;tone&quot;, to give the user more power to guide the AI to create text that actually fits their needs
- openAIs pricing is amazing. My v1 had GPT-3 calls and 100 people tried it out. I paid $1.69 that month. NOW I have the chatGPT API hooked up which costs 10x LESS than the GPT-3 endpoint. So now I&#x27;ll pay around $0.17 for 100 user prompts.
- That gives me more freedom to create bigger prompts making them even better without paying myself to bankruptcy<p>If you have any questions or feedback, I&#x27;d love to hear it.",story,https://www.schreiberling.app/en,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35068347,Ask HN: Why “Sort By” button on YouTube is so silly?,2023-03-08T12:48:35Z,eimrine,1,false,false,,,,,,I&#x27;m talking about the line which has &quot;NNN Comments&quot; indicator trailed by &quot;Sort By&quot; button. The line is almost empty and all it has is two buttons. The &quot;Sort By&quot; button calls the widget which is a bit annoying. The widget I&#x27;m talking about has two buttons which is appearing after clicking the &quot;Sort By&quot;. But why Youtube did the widget if he can just give us the two buttons in the same line with number of comments?<p>I recommend you to open any Youtube video in desktop browser to see what I mean. I love to toggle between &quot;top comments&quot; and &quot;newest first&quot; so this widget bothers me because this is one extra click and one extra aiming (widget can appear upwards or downwards depends of state of scrolling the page inside of the window).<p>Any versions about why the widget exists? Maybe it can give Youtube few extra cents per visitor or am I miss something?,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35068544,Show HN: Earthly 0.7.0 – Simpler and Faster Builds,2023-03-08T13:09:29Z,adamgordonbell,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN. Earthly is an open-source build tool ( and now a SAAS CI), and we&#x27;ve just released 0.7.0, our most significant release since early 2022.<p>Our article about RCE as a service was on the front page [0], but the specifics of how the open-source build tool works might be more directly relevant to hn readers.<p>Earthly is like a modern version of a makefile that uses containerization for file system separation and reproducibility. We want to give people the speed and correctness of Bazel with the simplicity of Make and Dockerfiles.<p>So much time is wasted in builds starting from scratch when little has changed between runs. Earthly can speed up builds by building a DAG of the build steps, tracking what is changing, and aggressively caching to prevent rework.<p>This approach works very well in Monorepos, where rebuilding everything from scratch with each build becomes impractical past a certain size. But, of course, these techniques work with polyrepo setups as well.<p>The Earthfile syntax draws inspiration from Dockerfiles, Makefiles, and shell scripting and leans heavily on simplicity [1].<p>Usually, you aren&#x27;t in your build scripts every day, so keeping things approachable is key. The simple syntax is our most divisive feature and where we get the most positive feedback from users.<p>We were on HN a couple of years ago [2], and we&#x27;ve been adding features and improving things since then. Most notably, we&#x27;ve added podman support and our WAIT command. Earthly pushes you towards parallelism in your build, and WAIT allows you to constrain this in specific deployment scenarios.<p>Let me know what you think of what we built.<p>We take HN feedback pretty seriously ( last show HN led to a license change (MPL 2.0 now)).<p>0: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35059992"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35059992</a><p>1: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earthly.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;platform-values&#x2F;#approachability"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earthly.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;platform-values&#x2F;#approachability</a><p>2: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27785323"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27785323</a>",story,https://earthly.dev/blog/earthly-v0-7/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
