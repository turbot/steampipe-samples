Both leave a lot to be desired, particularly around teams &amp; permissions, that I&#x27;m considering to build a product around if others have similar problems. I&#x27;m curious if you have the same problems and what products you&#x27;re already using to solve said problems.<p>Here&#x27;s my list:<p>1. For eng orgs of 50+ people, I&#x27;d like to setup an org that folks can SSO into via Google&#x2F;SAML&#x2F;whatever to acquire new domains under said org. This would include tools like an approval workflow so that a security or purchasing person can approve requests to buy new domains.<p>2. I&#x27;d like to have better ACLs for managing the DNS records of said domains. I think AWS, Google, Azure, etc. have some levels of this in their products, but setting it up isn&#x27;t for the faint of heart. I&#x27;d like to see something that&#x27;s more &quot;baked&quot; and simper to manage permissions around administering DNS records. e.g. I could have a policy for `*.example.dev` domains that let folks grab whatever sub-domain, but maybe only a few people can manage `www.example.com` records with the approval of another admin (like the two-key approach to launching ICBMs)<p>3. I want a CLI. It&#x27;s insane that I have to fire up a browser when I want to change DNS records.<p>I think https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dnsimple.com&#x2F; comes the closest, and possibly solves most or all of these problems. Its really hard to tell from the demo or trial, which is why I&#x27;m asking here.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
