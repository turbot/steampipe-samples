My own personal experience with rapid reading techniques began circa 1983 when an article I&#x27;d stumbled upon suggested I use a cursor (mine was a coffee stir stick). I wasn&#x27;t looking for a speed boost per se, but my speed improved dramatically, and I have not had to use such a cursor in many years. Some people and studies say that speed reading is a fallacy. So, the friend for who I am asking about Kwik Brain is hoping someone can give a thumbs up or down about Kwik Brain or the notion of a speed reading course or system in general.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.kwikbrain.com&#x2F;",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
