34848353,Ask HN: Has ChatGPT gotten worse at coding for anyone else?,2023-02-18T16:50:35Z,Michelangelo11,1,false,false,,,,,,"I used it for coding in Python, often with the python-docx library, about six weeks ago, and it was superb. It gave me exactly what I wanted, which is no mean feat for a semi-obscure little library, and I was delighted. Then I tried it again a few weeks ago and it did worse than before, but I thought maybe it was just bad luck. Using it today, though, it seemed really really bad and it messed up some very basic Python features, like the walrus operator -- it got so bad that I gave up on it and went back to google and stack overflow.<p>The performance drop is so steep that I can only imagine they crippled the model, probably to cope with the explosion in demand. Has anyone else seen the same thing?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;ve been working on a new browser-based design tool that&#x27;s ready for you to try.<p>The idea is you work on your design in low fidelity wireframes, while still getting a high fidelity output that you can share or use as a reference for your implementation. The way it works is by mapping low fidelity blocks you draw into high fidelity design system &amp; React components.<p>I spent several years working on design tools at companies like Airbnb, and I think the ideas behind many of the tools we built for designing at scale could really help startups and small teams as well. I would love any feedback you have!<p>PS: Most of Noya is open source at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noya-app&#x2F;noya"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noya-app&#x2F;noya</a>",story,https://www.noya.io/home,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
