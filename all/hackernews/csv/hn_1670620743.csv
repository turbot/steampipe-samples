People will trust real faces and influencers more.<p>-&gt; New sites like video, audio boards replacing reddit and old-school forums (harder to fake video and audio). Think clubhouse+reddit with histories.<p>-&gt; Then people will realize they can still use AI to generate content for their video, audio text but AT LEAST they will have some human input and it won&#x27;t be just bots leading to dead internet theory.<p>-&gt; Eventually it will be just video, because probably within few years voice generation will be immaculate<p>Thoughts?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
