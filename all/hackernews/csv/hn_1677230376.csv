The worse fee that I have had to pay was 100USD but that was during the NFT craze and it still was less then what paypal charges<p>I&#x27;ve just recently for the first time in ages used Paypal for invoicing and was charged about 5%.<p>This is insane. I was charged over 90 USD to invoice 3000 USD? Isn&#x27;t their process automated or are they still doing accounting by hand. I could pay an accountant to do the invoice for less.<p>Why are their fees so high (aside from demand&#x2F;supply) surely this gives room for a startup to come in and take the a fixed transactional basis rate?<p>Does anyone have any alternatives to Paypal that doesn&#x27;t charge on a percentage basis?<p>TLDR: Been spoilt using crypto for transactions and the fees are significantly less then Paypal.<p>How is paypal still charging this rate?,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
