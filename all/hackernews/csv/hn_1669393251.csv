These customers are small gyms in local areas with accounts active for the last 11 months without no issues whatsoever, now all of a sudden they were both suspended (and payout blocked) due to suspicious activity. The suspicious activity is disputed payments, which for SEPA DD (the main payment method used) can simply be that the customer has no money in the bank account.<p>The Stripe response so far has been vague, to say the least. Has this happened to you?<p>I believe Stripe is a very good product and we have had no issue with them until now, but this situation is deteriorating trust very fast.
