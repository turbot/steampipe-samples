35087964,Show HN: DeepAI Hotline – a conversational AI assistant over traditional phone,2023-03-09T22:51:52Z,etaioinshrdlu,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi all, we’re happy to present this demo we’re calling “DeepAI Hotline”. We were interested in ways to bring ChatGPT capabilities to people around the world, particularly those who might not be comfortable with computers and smartphones. We felt that the old-school phone system was potentially a good way to do this.<p>We built this using the Vocode SDK: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vocode.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vocode.dev</a> (YCW23).<p>Some of the feedback we’ve heard is that it responds to questions impressively fast, and it feels relatively natural compared to older assistants like Siri.<p>Another funny one: “Feels more real than some people in customer service”.<p>One of the harder problems faced with this technology is “endpointing” - how the system detects when the user is done speaking and the AI should respond. It is challenging because any inaccuracy leads to responding too soon or too late, which makes the conversation feel less natural.<p>We had fun building this! Please give it a try and let us know what you think!<p>You can call it here:  1-669-333-3724<p>Thanks and Enjoy!<p>-- DeepAI",story,https://deepai.org/hotline,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
