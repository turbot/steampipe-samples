As it becomes more advanced, it may be difficult to distinguish its responses from those of a human. This blurring of the line between AI and humanity raises questions about the ethical treatment of AI and whether it should have rights.

33949038,Tell HN: Amazon shows different (worse) pricing when logged in,2022-12-12T00:00:07Z,gnicholas,16,false,false,13,"[33949245,33949280,33949188,33949165,33949133]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"I was browsing Amazon in incognito (via Brave) today. I found some shoes I wanted to get, copied the URL, and pasted it into a Brave window that is logged into my Amazon account.<p>The incognito window showed $79 for my size&#x2F;color, but the logged-in window showed $85. It didn&#x27;t matter how many times I reloaded either page — neither changed. Ultimately I logged the incognito window into my Amazon account to get that pricing, since it was clear there was no other way. The purchase went through at $79 + tax.<p>But this experience makes me much more wary about Amazon pricing. There is not one &#x27;price&#x27; — there is just the price they&#x27;re showing you right now. They may show higher prices to logged in accounts, possibly based on attributes of the accountholder (buying history, zip code, etc.). It makes me think that I shouldn&#x27;t just browse in incognito — I should be using a VPN as well.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s also possible this is a glitch (one that just happens to be profitable for Amazon).<p>Here&#x27;s the full link (I tried pasting with and without the tracking code at the end): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;KEEN-Voyageur-Height-Breathable-Hiking&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B071Y5XFRS?th=1&amp;psc=1",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
