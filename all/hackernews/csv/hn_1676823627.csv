I intend to add more over time.<p>I submitted this back in October, and people enjoyed it, but asked for the words to be clickable if they have a page in my thesaurus, and for terms to be separated by parts of speech. So I have done these.<p>I have also started hewing down the lists of synonyms, which began as the Moby Thesaurus list but are slowly being curated over time. (The dataset is too large and with too many irrelevancies, and is missing several common words such as &quot;wish&quot;).
