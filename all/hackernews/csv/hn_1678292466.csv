35070143,How we built a social network with No-Code,2023-03-08T15:27:00Z,ishbaid,2,false,false,2,[35070198],,,,"In the Fall of last year, we launched a social network for college students with No-Code.<p>Here’s how we did it:<p>Last summer (after having conversations with a few dozen college students), we stumbled across a very interesting insight:<p>*80% of college students aren’t on Facebook anymore*.<p>Sure, tools like Snapchat and Instagram exist that represent someone’s social graph, but there isn’t a central place for students to go get guidance from other peers. For students to even do simple transactions like exchanging textbooks, finding roommates, or buying sports tickets is messy.<p>This gave us the idea that just maybe students were hungry for a new social network to fill the void Facebook left behind.<p>Our goal was to create a digital community where students could discuss campus life, discover housing options, and buy&#x2F;sell from other students.<p>### Step 1: Build the Platform<p>To make this happen, we started by setting up a (Circle)[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circle.so&#x2F;] community specifically for our first college, the University of Michigan (Go Blue!). We then customized the community&#x27;s branding and design to fit with UofM’s colors and overall aesthetic.<p>Next, we created different spaces within the community for different topics, such as &quot;Ask UMich,&quot; &quot;Class Reviews,&quot; “Buy&#x2F;Sell,” and &quot;Events.&quot;<p>Lastly, we then threw together a marketing page using Webflow and used Zapier to sync all user content into an Airtable to run analytics.<p>*Tech Stack:*<p>Marketing website: Webflow (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peervine.io&#x2F;)<p>Community: Circle<p>Database: Airtable<p>Syncing: Zapier<p>Operations: Retool<p>###  Step 2: Launch<p>Getting students into the platform was easy enough. We just showed up on campus and bribed them with free cookies and pizza. This got us to our first 500 students on the platform.<p>We made sure to promote the community heavily on campus through flyers, social media posts, and announcements at student events.<p>*Step 2.5 (optional): Build a mobile app*<p>We didn’t have an app when we launched and quickly realized that was going to be a problem.<p>Our hack was simply to create a React Native app that rendered a web view wrapped around our Circle community. It wasn’t ideal, but it got the job done).<p>###  Step 3: Growth<p>After launch, most of our effort was focused on growing our community. We used a variety of different tactics, from referral contests to even a match-making service that 3x-ed our growth.<p>Within 12 weeks, had more than 10% of Michigan&#x27;s undergrad population on the platform (roughly 3,000+ students).<p>##  WHY did we do this?<p>We get asked this a lot. Since we have our engineering team, why not build this in-house? It came down to this:<p>It was cheaper and faster.<p>We’ve learned that most of the components of a social network (feed, profiles, messaging, events, etc…) are all a commodity. What matters much more is <i>who</i> is on the platform and whether or not they are deriving value from the network.<p>So we decided to focus energy on building the community instead of reinventing the wheel.<p>Plus, we really didn’t know what our audience would resonate with from a product perspective. Circle allowed us to spin up experiments in just hours rather than weeks. When you’re a small startup, these savings make a *monumental* difference.<p>###  What’s Next?<p>We’re fundraising! We’ve proven that the model can work on one campus. Now, we want to launch at new campuses.<p>##  Reflections<p>Through this process, we learned the power of the No Code ecosystem.<p>Too many founders (including myself) feel the need to build products for the sake of building instead of finding scrappy ways to prove (or disprove) their hypothesis.<p>But users don’t care if you built your own platform. They only care whether or not you solve their problem.<p>In the end, that’s what really matters.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It&#x27;s an admin panel for devs and non-devs alike to manage your DB. We see teams use Plato for customer support, customer success, ops, etc..<p>We built Plato because we think more people should be able to build and extend internal tools. We thought it was strange that even though low-code is supposed to democratize development, all of the low-code internal tool builders are marketed to engineers! Airtable is a familiar UI that fits the relational model well, so we&#x27;ve been inspired by their work. Even the engineers on our team use Plato quite a bit, since it&#x27;s often easier than spinning up a SQL prompt.<p>Some features:<p>- Postgres and MySQL support<p>- Visual query controls (sorts, filters, hiding columns). No SQL.<p>- Joins by &quot;expanding&quot; foreign keys<p>- Virtual columns for tracking new data<p>- Auto-generated backlinks for one-to-many relationships<p>- Read-only locking for individual tables<p>- Virtual tables for sharing new views with your team<p>Plato today works on databases with a public IP (just whitelist our IP to connect), but we&#x27;re soon rolling out an on-prem version.

35070257,Show HN: AI LiLi – Chat with Your NFTs and Custom Chatbots on Discord,2023-03-08T15:34:38Z,chiehminwei,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi everyone,<p>I&#x27;m the developer of Ai LiLi, a new Discord chatbot that brings personalities to your NFTs and allows you to chat with them.<p>Ai LiLi is unique in that it allows you to customize the personalities of your NFTs, and then chat with them on Discord. So if you have a Bored Ape in your wallet, you can use Ai LiLi to generate a personality for them. Or you can simply create new NFTs with custom personalities, and talk with them through Ai LiLi.<p>You can also invite your friends and a bunch of NFTs into the same group chat, and share the fun together.<p>But you don&#x27;t have to worry about NFTs if you don&#x27;t want to. You can also just use Ai LiLi as a regular chatbot app, and create new chatbots with custom personalities of your own. You can even get rewarded for your hard work crafting the desired personalities.<p>So if you&#x27;re a Discord user who wants to chat with your NFTs or just create new chatbots with custom personalities, I invite you to check out Ai LiLi. You can get started by going to our landing page at [ailili.app](<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ailili.app"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ailili.app</a>).
