35257469,Show HN: AI World News Poetry,2023-03-22T06:18:32Z,horseluvvaslim,1,false,false,,,,,,"I wasted a couple of hours today making a site that generates AI authored poems based on world news headlines.<p>The news comes from the BBC, verse from OpenAI API and it writes a new poem every 20 minutes (faster than the news typically moves, I&#x27;ve found.)<p>This effort was partly inspired by Matt Webb’s AI clock (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;genmon&#x2F;status&#x2F;1636698753007603713"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;genmon&#x2F;status&#x2F;1636698753007603713</a>) which writes a poem each minute that contains the current time. I thought this was brilliant. Kind of a poetic AI version of Christian Marclay’s 24-hour cinematic masterpiece “The Clock” which sequentially stitched together a whole day of clocks and watches from the history of film.<p>I experimented with my own version of this but the results were always a bit naff and motivational.<p>Using AI for summarising and presenting real world data as a kind of ambient display is an idea that stuck with me, though, and this is the result.<p>Is it actually useful? Could it be a viable replacement for news doom scrolling? I’m not sure yet. Probably not. It was fun to make, though. Let me know what you think of the results.",story,https://newspoem.vercel.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Also had to buy a virtual number online to allow setting up a WhatsApp account with. The WhatsApp servers receive the message from the WhatsApp mobile application, which forward a webhook request to the application server I setup. The request gets forwarded to the ChatGPT API (i.e the OpenAI Chat API), and voila, you are now in conversation with ChatGPT<p>Interestingly, the ChatGPT API does not provide context recognition from previous conversations out of the box. That is something that needs to be built in manually. So currently, the ChatsApp service does not include the context recognition from previous conversations. Maybe something to look at building out in the future.",story,https://chatsapp.carrd.co,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
