You can import NPM libraries, create and render React components, and more in a multiplayer (or local account-less) environment. If you login and create a synced canvas, you can invite other users to collaborate with multiple cursors, etc.<p>My favorite feature is opt-dragging (alt-drag on windows) to duplicate panes, making it really easy to try new ideas. You can accomplish something similar with git branch but it&#x27;s not as easy and you don&#x27;t have multiple versions running side-by-side.<p>Check out the gallery for example use cases <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;natto.dev&#x2F;gallery"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;natto.dev&#x2F;gallery</a>.
