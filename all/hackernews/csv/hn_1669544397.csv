33761767,Show HN: Affordable cloud storage and my story,2022-11-27T09:56:43Z,Tom_DataHoarder,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi there,<p>I&#x27;m Tom and I am a DataHoarder :)
I&#x27;m based in Europe and I am a PHP programmer.<p>I&#x27;ve been Hoarding Data for over two decades now, going through all phases (losing data, having multiple copies of them, 3-2-1 rules etc), and I&#x27;ve noticed that it is getting very expensive after a while (well, you can notice that very fast nowadays hah).<p>All these started when I wanted to grab a couple of extra TBs of online storage to backup some secondary data. There aren&#x27;t many affordable (mind you, $5-$7&#x2F;TB might be cheap for some) options out there and all I wanted was to share a box with someone.<p>So I&#x27;ve decided to make a little project to &quot;fix&quot; this. Maybe there are more people out there who think the same (you never know until you try?).
I&#x27;ve had my ups and downs but this is something I was really excited to code. This is also the first project I created after a long time (so please be kind :)). Hopefully it will make me get back to the game.<p>I&#x27;m basically splitting up the servers, no overselling or anything like that, and you can use (S)FTP, SCP, rsync, Rclone, Duplicati, BorgBackup to create your backups.<p>I&#x27;m offering 100GB Trials for a week for you to play around and provide any kind of feedback so I can improve either the quality of the service or the website itself. I know it requires a signup and email verification but I tried to make it as painless as possible :(<p>I&#x27;m already working on the next phase (the first one wasn&#x27;t anything special, just a basic build :)) which I think can do wonders to decrease the cost of online storage even further. Hopefully it will be ready sometime in Q1 2023. I will let you know :)<p>Thank you for your time!
