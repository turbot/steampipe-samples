So for their first post in a topic, something like:<p><pre><code>  aardv 16 minutes ago #1 | root | parent | next [–]

This is a fundamental problem of social media, and one of the ways IMO to have better discussions is to limit people&#x27;s participation.  For example, if a person could only post a handful of times to a topic, they would likely make sure that their comment is important enough to use up one of their limited posts rather than engaging in long back-and-forths with one person.
