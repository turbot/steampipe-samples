34815014,Ask HN: Any possible legal issues from disclosing security vulnerabilities?,2023-02-16T04:27:03Z,accidentalcurl,2,false,false,,,,,,"I was looking at the network requests made by a relatively niche, small, and new social network I&#x27;m on. It turns out their security practices are absolutely terrible and they leak tons of info like the email, phone, and hashed but unsalted passwords of every user. This is all available at unauthenticated endpoints (i.e. not just incorrectly set permissions, but no login needed at all).<p>I&#x27;d like to responsibly disclose these issues but have never done something like that before and am slightly afraid of any possible legal repercussions. Even if I&#x27;m technically in the right, an expensive and career-damaging lawsuit is something I really want to avoid.<p>I could report these issues anonymously but I suspect a smart person looking through the server logs would be able to de-anonymize me. I did change up some URL parameters to verify that the vulnerability worked (e.g. &quot;GET api&#x2F;users&#x2F;myuser&quot; -&gt; &quot;GET api&#x2F;users&#x2F;anotheruser&quot;) and produced some weird traffic in the process, all while working from a browser that I was currently logged in with. I&#x27;d like to think that I didn&#x27;t do anything wrong but I know that hacking laws can encompass anything outside of normal usage.<p>Does anyone have advice? I could leave it alone but the issues are so bad that someone else will find it sooner or later if they haven&#x27;t already.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I would like to apprentice with someone who is well-versed in aspects of real-time multiplayer games. Preferably someone who has been doing it for decades. I can write you working networks, I can pretty much make most single-player. Real-time game simulation and the art of has seemed to be lost to the public sources of information and tend to become focused at places with a lot of money to offer. If you are this said person, I would be willing to work for you, grunt work on your other projects. This would be in return for creating starting points, answering questions, guidance other than what the algorithm on youtube predicts next, and that type of things. If it woks out well, I&#x27;ll give you a percentage of any multiplayer games that are released.
