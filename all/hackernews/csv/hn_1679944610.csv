Think of it like a Bing Chat but that will search the documents you have in your knowledge base instead of the web.<p>Tech details: To build the knowledge base, we use a combination of embeddings, summarizing and pre-processing to allow the ability to have full context of what is in a given document (say 40+ pages) and conditional prompting depending what the document is (ex: an excel file will be processed a bit differently than a word&#x2F;pdf file). For the AI assistant, it’s a mix a clever prompting,  using the Q&amp;A tool when in need of information and “self-reinforcement” &#x2F; “grounding” to keep it on the rails.<p>In the future, I want to give more tools to the assistant (improved math, task automation, internet access) and an API to make it easy to add&#x2F;update your knowledge base or integrate knowledge-augmented models into products easily. Also, with LLMs having their Stable Diffusion moment, I think in the next few months we’ll be able to have a self-host version of the product which will be very exciting.<p>I’d love to get some feedback (on the features, pricing, use cases, etc.) or answer any questions you may have!<p>Cheers,<p>Iliane",story,https://alceos.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35330977,Built a ChatGPT Chrome extension in a week with no coding experience,2023-03-27T19:11:41Z,designaas,1,false,false,,,,,,"I was curious to see if GPT-4 hype is real so I tried an experiment with it…
I’m a designer and have never coded in my life. So I tried to build a fully functional chrome extension with ChatGPT functionality that also allows you to save your prompts.
Here’s what happened<p>Day 1 - Non-believer 
I spent the evening figuring out what type of extension I could potentially build and settled on one that integrates ChatGPT prompting with the added functionality to save prompts.<p>Day 2 - Entering the Matrix  
After years of hearing about people spinning up servers, I finally did it myself with guidance from ChatGPT. Using the terminal, I could get it up and running much easier than I thought it would be, in preparation for the extension.<p>Day 3 - Building Rome in a Day 
With about 30 prompts, I was able to get something mildly functional with little stress. It was mind-blowing to see that it was giving me functional code, and I&#x27;d integrated OpenAI&#x27;s API to get responses.<p>Day 4 - Training dAI 
Although it was easy to get something working, I quickly realized that asking the same prompt multiple times could result in different results. This made minor issues mammoth, and arguing became essential.<p>Day 5 &amp; 6 - Icarus 
The extension works! It was an unbelievable feeling to go from 0-100 so quickly. I wanted to show the world! I prompted for help setting up a server on Heroku and ended up breaking everything. After hours of failing, I moved back to my lane locally.<p>Day 7 - ChatEXT 
The extension is complete! It can search using GPT from any website, save prompts and outputs, copy prompts to clipboard, search saved responses, save your history locally, and delete saved responses on demand.<p>Building this extension was a fantastic learning experience. It was exciting to see the progress I made each day, and it was gratifying to know that I could build something that I never thought was possible. With tools like ChatGPT and a willingness to learn, anything is possible, even for non-coders like me. Now I&#x27;m going to sleep<p>To see a demo of the extension you can find it here:   https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;efesopoulos&#x2F;status&#x2F;1640382875173285889",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
