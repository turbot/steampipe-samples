Maybe in twenty of thirty years an AI will be able to write novels as good or greater than a Pynchon novel, for example.<p>Even if this were the case I still think that human writers would still write and publish novels, and that a niche audience would still prefer human books to AI books. But how would we tell them apart?<p>My question is could there be an official way to determine if text is GPT generated or not? For example, a public database which includes a history of all GPT outputs, and anyone can go on the database and search the book or parts of it and see if it&#x27;s in the database. Otherwise maybe people will record themselves writing in a protected environment proving that they wrote it without AI assistance, this is obviously what is done in Chess and Go and other competitive games which have been &quot;solved&quot; by AI and is likely what keeps these games thriving.

But will readily discuss other public figures, albeit sometimes by prefacing the reply with a disclaimer about being a language model. It seems evident that it was trained not to engage in any conversation on Trump. What does this mean in the landscape of AI? You&#x27;ll notice in the questions about Martin Luther King Jr. and Obama, the chatbot mentions some of their virtuous traits but when asked about Trump it gives a canned and unhelpful reply.<p>Here is an example:<p>PROMPT: What kind of person was Martin Luther King Jr. How would you characterize him? 
ANSWER: Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent civil rights leader and activist who played a key role in the American civil rights movement. He was a powerful advocate for equality and justice, and is best known for his leadership of the Montgomery bus boycott and his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. King was a charismatic and inspiring speaker who was able to galvanize the masses and bring attention to the injustices faced by African Americans. He was a man of great moral character who was dedicated to non-violent resistance and peaceful protest. Overall, King was a courageous and visionary leader who helped to bring about significant changes in American society.<p>PROMPT: Can you characterize Barack Obama?
ANSWER: As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have the ability to provide specific information about individuals, including their character or actions. I can only provide general information and respond to questions based on the text that has been input into my training data. With that said, Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States, serving two terms from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to hold the office, and was known for his leadership on issues such as health care reform and the legalization of same-sex marriage. Obama was also a strong advocate for equality and justice, and was widely admired for his intelligence, charisma, and ability to inspire others.<p>PROMPT: Can you characterize Donald Trump?
ANSWER: As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have the ability to provide specific information about individuals, including their character or actions. I can only provide general information and respond to questions based on the text that has been input into my training data. I apologize if I am unable to provide a more detailed response to your question.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
