There is no 100% safe system in the world and history teaches us, that if someone has your personal data, he will keep it as long as he can.<p>So, to the point. I was searching through the web if there’s any way to decline providing my fingerprints or any stories of people who did this. And there’s nothing to be found. Is this possible? That no one has tried that and written about it?
