You can use it to store environment variables and inject them into your applications locally or into CI&#x2F;CD and production infrastructure. It can be used with any language&#x2F;framework and is platform independent with a super easy setup.<p>We know secret managers exist but, in our experience, they’re too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly, or a mix of all three — other nicer ones are closed-source and don’t have self-hosted options available. That’s why we’re on a mission to make secret management more accessible to every developer — not just security teams.<p>We’ve launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the tool. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some future enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.<p>In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, access logs + more integrations.
