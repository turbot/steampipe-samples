You can purchase from as low as a single gram and select from both natural and technological removal methods.<p>Longer: A couple of years ago we launched an alternative to carbon credits, Carbon Removed[2], designed for individuals to buy and subscribe to CDR. But we always had the nagging thought that there was more that could be done.<p>CDR Platform is our foundation for that - a simple API to get prices and purchase (at the moment). Our plan is to become the Stripe of the carbon removal ecosystem, seamlessly connecting the supply to the demand.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback. Do you see a use case for this and would you use it? What features have we missed? Do you understand what we’re doing and if not, what’s unclear? We’d love to hear from you.[3]<p>Many thanks and happy hacking, Climacrux.<p>P.s. If you are a carbon remover, send us your prices, life cycle analysis and some more information about your removal timeline.
