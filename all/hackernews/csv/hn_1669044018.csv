I studied architecture, and I&#x27;ve been working in different branches of construction since the early 2000s, HTML and CSS was something I liked, in my university years I used a little bit of Macromedia Flash and most recently I use Wordpress for my personal website, but I never had that thinking ability to develop something new, most of it was copy and paste code.<p>I&#x27;m married with kids and an eight to five job, I had just 4 hrs per week, more or less, to learn something to code, I took the CS50x course, and one Zero To Mastery Course on JS, and this is a small project to check my learning process.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading HN since the late 2020, I understand just probably 5% of the submissions, and that number might be high, most of the time I found myself scratching my head, but I learn every day a little bit more about technology and what people involved in technology are doing. That is the reason I wanted to post my work here.<p>I know this project can&#x27;t be compared to the amazing things you guys are doing, but I it&#x27;s for sure a lot better than what I could do three years ago.<p>I hope you find superflexbox.com useful.",story,https://superflexbox.com/about.html,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Majority of products I see (that &quot;build in public&quot; thing etc.) are feeding off the same comunity.<p>I.e. they selling each other some tools (fancy screenshot editors for marketing, &quot;grow your twitter&quot; kind of things, ebooks) that would hopefully help to finally create and sell your dream product.<p>It looks like the same old ponzi scheme in disguise. And economically is (money just circle around the same community inflating expectations on each revolution).<p>2. Isn&#x27;t it so that tiny portion of the products eventually grow into real startups or businesses with employees, scaling, different priorities etc? Which looks like all this IHS was just a mask in the first place.<p>While the rest end up with inspiring&#x2F;regretful blog posts after few years of struggle, or die right from the start if the author is lucky enough?<p>Even though the authors are often really talented and hardworking people, sometimes even finding their market (that eventually slips away).<p>3. If an indie hacker finds some good market niche and it&#x27;s big enough or growing — doesn&#x27;t it put him immidiately in the competition with hundreds of small and big companies (the bigger the niche - the bigger the companies)?<p>What can this hacker then possibly do to win this battle long-term?<p>If this niche is small (long tail), yet big enough to support the founder — doesn&#x27;t this put him in the competition with thousands of other hackers aiming at low hanging fruit?<p>Let&#x27;s say our hacker is the most brilliant one in the niche. Doesn&#x27;t the mere fact of thousands of people tearing the small niche apart make this a loose-loose game anyway?<p>Of course all above just based on personal observations, which are obviously skewed.<p>This is why I&#x27;m looking for other perspectives, examples, counter-examples and anything meaningful you have to say on this.<p>Thank you for reading to this point :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
