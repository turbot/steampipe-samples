35406447,Trying ChatGPT via Bing's Chat,2023-04-02T02:15:44Z,graycat,1,false,false,,,,,,"At Microsoft&#x27;s Bing feature Chat I gave
two questions:<p>(1) My first question asked for a solution to<p>y&#x27;(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))<p>Right away Chat noticed that this was
calculus and would involve exponential
growth.  Then it gave me links to
references with examples of exponential
growth and differential equations.<p>But the response was nothing like a
solution, e.g., in TeX:<p>y(t) = { y(0) b e^{bkt} \over y(0) \big (
e^{bkt} - 1 \big ) + b }<p>So, Chat can respond with content about
differential equations but can&#x27;t actually
solve an exercise in first calculus.<p>(2) I gave Chat the question:<p>Given triangle ABC, construct D on side AB
and E on side BC so that the lengths AD =
DE = EC.<p>Chat had no answer, not even a hint or
clue, how to do that.<p>But it did present some materials on
triangles, all either irrelevant or not
better than trivially relevant.<p>My Response:  For some queries Chat may be
a little better than Bing or Google.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

One aspect of my own interactions I&#x27;ve noticed is that the chat nature of the interface has me writing fairly verbose prompts.

Or are you still writing full sentences?<p>I understand that giving context is often important.

35406342,Show HN: Create Spotify playlists using ChatGPT,2023-04-02T01:58:30Z,kgmodi,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello all,<p>This is my first submission on Hacker News. Recently, like many others, I&#x27;ve been playing around with ChatGPT APIs and have been impressed with the capabilities that have been unlocked through the APIs.<p>For example, ChatGPT could &quot;recommend&quot; me songs that can introduce me to different kinds of music - &quot;Popular American music from the 90s&quot; or &quot;Classical Indian music&quot; or &quot;Songs that have won the Original Song Award at the Oscars.&quot; Or you could even ask for &quot;early morning CrossFit workout music.&quot;<p>So instead of adding these recommendations manually, I integrated ChatGPT responses with Spotify APIs to make a public playlist. That is the idea behind <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playlistgenius.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playlistgenius.com</a> - Create playlists using ChatGPT recommendations.<p>I am no expert on the correctness of the recommendations, and some of these playlists may already be available on Spotify (curated by humans). However, the capability of expressing user intent in human language for such use cases excites me.<p>There are limitations to the recommendations. For example, music data after 2021 is almost absent in the recommendations due to the training data cut off for version 3.5.<p>There are some known issues in the implementation too that I need to work on. For example - sometimes a song may be added more than once in the same playlist.<p>Please give www.playlistgeniusai.com a try.<p>I would appreciate any general or specific feedback on this app as I start work on integrating feedback (support for other service providers like YT music, etc.), fixing bugs, and releasing the next version.",story,https://www.playlistgeniusai.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

However, I will be the sole developer on the team. I&#x27;ve been in this scenario before, after graduating I joined a company with six developers. Pretty quickly, the other developers departed, and I was the only one left. During this time, I did not make any attempt to stay current with industry best practices and missed out on valuable knowledge and experience. When I joined the last company, I found it challenging to keep up with Jira tasks, retrospect meetings, and the speed at which the other developers were completing tasks (I think my inability to keep pace contributed to my layoff). Therefore, I am determined to avoid repeating this mistake except I don&#x27;t know how, or how to improve my speed?<p>The new position is at a university.
