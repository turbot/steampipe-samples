33557974,Is This Your First Time Doing Something? It Is No Big Deal,2022-11-11T06:46:35Z,prasenjit_pro,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"One of the things I noticed that I tend to do is build up a milestone I want to achieve, especially “the first x” and make a big deal about it in my head. Like when I was building Proxies API, I would build this narrative that I couldn’t wait to finish developing. It creates weird anxiety that helps nobody. Then when I finished it, I would make a big deal about “the first customer.”<p>“If only I can get my first customer…. then it would be xxx”, I would say to myself. Then if it didn’t happen, I would feel desperate for nothing. It is funny, but I wouldn’t make such a big deal about my second customer. Why? There is something weirdly superstitious about the 1st time of anything.<p>This very act of giving it space in my mind makes it somehow more and more challenging to achieve. Now I have changed my attitude towards the 1st anything.<p>My first customer happened soon after, and so did the next hundred.<p>I want to notice milestones in my rearview mirror, never as I reach them, and not anticipate and look for them. I wish to acknowledge signs but never focus on them. I don’t even want to celebrate them too because that tells my brain that the next one is even more difficult and yet significant a deal, and my mind then makes it real. Now when I achieve them, I stand my own as if to say, of course, I realized them.<p>If you can’t stop making a big deal about the 1st of something, counter it with making a big deal about the 2nd one to mess with your head.<p>Let’s celebrate the 88th customer rather than the 100th one. The brain will then realize the ridiculousness of its belief and will let go.<p>The author is the founder of Proxies API, a proxy rotation API service.
