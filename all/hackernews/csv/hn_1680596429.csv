I do not know any electronics directly however, e.g. how to calculate or circuits or the like. I am familiar with gates and could build a basic theoretical CPU with them though.<p>For a long time I&#x27;ve been wanting to learn how to build something that &quot;bridges&quot; the software with hardware. Examples such as automatic dispensers which can be controlled from a microcontroller, turning the coffee machine from a microcontroller -- that kind of &quot;hacky&quot; home stuff.<p>Usually I never have any issues learning the basics of a hobby, but for some reason this have been very daunting for me and I never get a good intuitive grasp for it and have a hard time even getting started.<p>Do anyone have any success stories with learning this as a hobby? Do you need to understand circuits and electronics? People usually say &quot;just start on a project you want to do&quot;, but with electronics I find it really hard to even know what questions to ask and get comprehensible results from it on Google. It would be nice to go through 1200 pages of The Art of Electronics, but it&#x27;s hard to justify it and it&#x27;s probably not the happiest&#x2F;most valuable experience for me (I assume?).",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
