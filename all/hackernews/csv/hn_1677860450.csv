35011265,Show HN: Best Time to Buy – See the best time to buy stuff and save money,2023-03-03T15:58:32Z,lobsterthief,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN! I wanted to show you BTTB, a site I&#x27;ve been building off-and-on for the past year or so. I did all the end-to-end coding and design and enlisted the help of a few professional researchers and writers to gather and aggregate data. My background is in frontend engineering, design, and product development.<p>BTTB is a web app that illustrates the best time to buy common products (e.g. washing machines, snowblowers, TVs, fitness equipment, etc.) and notifies you the next time it&#x27;s a good time to buy. I also built some cool indicators like sale rarity.<p>Why I built it: We bought a new house while replacing some dying appliances I learned that _all_ sales cycles are cyclical, primarily driven by seasons (weather) or basic human behaviors. Of course, this concept works best for planned purchases since a dead refrigerator can&#x27;t wait.<p>We soft-launched it in December, having first shared it on Reddit (r&#x2F;internetisbeautiful) and got some constructive feedback. I&#x27;m excited to start sharing it more widely now.<p>---<p>Recent improvements based on early feedback:<p>- Better data transparency: Knowing _why_ a date is a good time to buy is as important as knowing the date itself. So I added the ability to store a reason with each date, which appears when you hover over a date in the heatmap. We&#x27;ve begun populating all of these, which will take some time, so right now they&#x27;re only available for certain product&lt;&gt;date relationships.<p>- Browsing by product: The first version only featured a month explorer on the homepage, which I replaced with a commonly-requested product explorer. The month explorer is a neat way to browse and plan your purchases though, so I moved it to its own page: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bttb.io&#x2F;what-to-buy-every-month"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bttb.io&#x2F;what-to-buy-every-month</a><p>- Highlight today: People thought it would be nice to have a page that shows you the best stuff to buy today, so I built that page here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bttb.io&#x2F;today"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bttb.io&#x2F;today</a><p>---<p>A bit about our data&#x2F;research process:<p>- Our researchers look for primary sources of data first (e.g. US government-provided purchase data). When this isn unavailable, we might use data aggregated by an industry publication or other trusted source—for example, a cruise line booking agency trade group or Statista for market trend analysis.<p>- When referencing articles that include a paragraph or two about when an item goes on sale, we&#x27;ll always verify the information with the sources listed in the article instead of using the article itself. If the article doesn&#x27;t include sources and we can&#x27;t corroborate the information elsewhere, we won&#x27;t use the article, and we&#x27;ll find sources elsewhere.<p>- We also perform searches using common search terms to identify when the largest companies in a given vertical normally run sales. We can build an accurate picture of when prices are lowest by aggregating data for multiple sale periods over multiple years.<p>---<p>Upcoming features:<p>- Adding 50-100 additional products.<p>- Completely automated ETL for identifying the best times to buy more granular products (for example, a single ASIN).<p>- Locales: Different country selection for tracking trends that differ by location.<p>- Additional notification mechanisms (email, SMS, browser push, etc.)<p>- Adding a changelog so people know what&#x27;s new (currently only doing this in the monthly newsletter).<p>---<p>Current limitations of the app:<p>- Not a ton of products yet; we&#x27;ve covered the major product categories and are in the process of adding a ton of new products.<p>- The data for some products and its sourcing are limited; we&#x27;re in the process of going through those earlier products and reworking their data sets, but they&#x27;re mostly accurate. Additionally, some of the original articles were not well-written and are being reworked.<p>- Notifications are currently limited to calendar (still the least intrusive method IMO given the current state of your inbox).<p>Would love to hear your thoughts and ideas!

It can prevent you from procrastinating and is a good motivator to actually start working and to keep distractions away.<p>• The timer can help you decide if it’s a good time to take a pause because you’ve been in the Zone for a long period, or if it is better to continue working because you’ve just entered the Zone.<p>• Your colleagues will notice the color change from yellow to red. This is a great signal that helps them understand the impact of interruptions on your productivity.<p>• Statistics help you measure your daily productive time.<p>• Using your phone for other purposes is considered an interruption by the app, so that’s already one distraction taken care of.",story,https://www.inthezoneapp.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
