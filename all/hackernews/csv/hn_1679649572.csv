35286604,Show HN: SaaSHub Experts,2023-03-24T08:49:18Z,stanislavb,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey fellow makers!<p>I&#x27;d like to introduce SaaSHub Experts here.<p>This is my Nth attempt to organize an active community around promoting software products. I&#x27;d describe SaaSHub Experts as an ongoing product tournament.<p>Why a tournament? Because every workday, the community selects the &quot;Top 5 products of the day&quot; (out of 15). Then, the results are aggregated every week by taking the Top 3 products and nominating them for &quot;Product of the Week&quot;. And we have Product of the Month &amp; Year similarly.<p>Why experts? Product owners and marketers grow their &quot;Expert Rating&quot; by selecting the Top 5 products. You have to choose the Top products according to the community. The more community-matching your selection is, the more points you get. With that in place, new users start with minimal influence and can only influence the result a little. This resolves the issue when someone invites people to register and vote for them.<p>Who&#x27;s the top competitor? I think that it is Product Hunt. My goal for SaaSHub Experts is to be the more objective version of Product Hunt. I.e. the best products should be featured instead of the products with the biggest following (as it is on PH).<p>Why would I want to take part? Every expert can set a product on focus to be featured on their profile and on the homepage of SaaSHub (as a nomination). You will have fun (I hope). You could consider it as a game for product makers as well.<p>Please let me know what you think. Let&#x27;s have fun together - promoting the best on the net.<p>Cheers!<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saashub.com&#x2F;experts&#x2F;about",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
