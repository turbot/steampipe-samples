Sometimes AI would hallucinate and produce nonsensical code, but a properly set prompt would correct the situation.<p>At times, it would forget what the last correct code was and start glitching again, so I had to resend the correct code.<p>At this stage, ChatGPT can replace a junior developer, but not more than that.
The GPT-4 model works better and produces clean code, but access is limited - you can only send up to 25 messages within 3 hours.<p>So, I completed the rest of the code using GPT 3.5 Turbo and subscribed to it.
I&#x27;m very pleased with the final code.<p>Keyboard Puzzle game!<p>The goal of this game is to restore the original order of the shuffled keyboard keys by swapping them with their correct positions within the time limit.<p>Here are the game rules:<p>Select a key from the shuffled keys below the main keyboard.
Click on a masked key in the main keyboard to swap them.
Continue swapping keys until the main keyboard is in its correct order.
You have 180 seconds to complete the puzzle.
Your score is based on the number of correctly placed keys.
