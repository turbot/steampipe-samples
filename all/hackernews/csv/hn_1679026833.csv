35192680,Show HN: GPT-CLI – A Command-line Interface for ChatGPT,2023-03-17T03:33:22Z,kharvd,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN! I&#x27;m excited to share my pet project, gpt-cli, a command-line interface for ChatGPT that makes interacting with the AI model easier and more customizable. This CLI tool enables you to chat with ChatGPT, choose between different assistants, and even create your own customized assistants by specifying the model, temperature, and top_p parameters. You can also set default configurations, making it a breeze to switch between assistants for various purposes like general assistance or software development advice.<p>gpt-cli provides a seamless experience with multi-line input and easy-to-use commands to control the conversation. It allows you to clear the conversation, regenerate the last response, or exit the session with simple keypresses. You can also override model parameters on the fly to fine-tune the AI&#x27;s output. To get started, simply set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable or put it in the ~&#x2F;.gptrc config file. Check out the README for more details on usage, configuration, and customization possibilities. I hope you find this tool helpful and fun to use, and I&#x27;m looking forward to your feedback and suggestions!<p>This post was generated by GPT-4 based on the project README.",story,https://github.com/kharvd/gpt-cli,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35192654,Tell HN: A 8000 tokens long chat with GPT-4 can cost more than $5 using the API,2023-03-17T03:30:08Z,BeenAGoodUser,2,false,false,2,[35192672],,,,"Just like about everyone I&#x27;m really impressed by GPT-4 and already a happy user of it via ChatGPT Plus, but something that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned a lot about GPT-4 is that while OpenAI has put a lot of emphasis on its usage as a chat bot, it doesn&#x27;t really seem cost effective to use it that way via the API for now, at least not for long length conversations.<p>I&#x27;m not sure at all that my calculations are right, but here they are for a conversation I just had with ChatGPT (GPT-4 model):
- It was about 8000 tokens long in total (counting both my messages and the ones of ChatGPT)
- I sent around 45 messages
- The answers of ChatGPT were about 100 tokens each<p>Assuming the token length of the conversation increased at a constant rate with each new message, we can consider that, on average, each sent message costs 4000 tokens (half of 8000, the final total conversation length).<p>The price of context tokens for the 8k model is $0.03 per 1000 tokens, the price of generated tokens is $0.06 per 1000 tokens.<p>If each sent message costs 4000 tokens on average, and that 100 (0.1k) of these tokens are generated tokens, that equates to 3900 (3.9k) context tokens on average, which means that for 45 sent messages you have (0.1 x 0.06 + 3.9 x 0.03) x 45 = $5.535<p>I feel like even for a personal usage, the costs would quickly become very high: even if you just had one conversation like this per day, that would be about $150 at the end of the month. That&#x27;s too much for me.<p>What&#x27;s your opinion about this? Did I get the computation right? Is it likely that OpenAI is having big margins?
