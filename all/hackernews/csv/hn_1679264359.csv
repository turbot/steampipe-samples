I like the &quot;bird-eye view&quot; it gives me on the product and its context within the business and how it allows me to coach the team towards better outcomes. However, I find myself struggling to be motivated by the Career Development&#x2F;Performance Management part of the job. I think I&#x27;m doing an okay job, but I fail to find the energy to be really good at it and produce plans that would make long-term improvements in the team. It might be because the effects of that work are so abstract and subject to so many variables that I don&#x27;t necessarily control that it&#x27;s really hard for me to judge that I&#x27;m &quot;good&quot;.<p>Now, I know that my job will require more and more of that type of work if I continue on the management track. So, people in that path (especially those who were devs before), how do you make sure that your job stays exciting?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
