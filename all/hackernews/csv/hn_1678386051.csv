35084227,Show HN: PyBroker – Algotrading in Python with Machine Learning,2023-03-09T17:51:17Z,pyfreak182,3,false,false,,,,,,"Hello, I am excited to share PyBroker with you, a free and open-source Python framework that I developed for creating algorithmic trading strategies, including those that utilize machine learning. With PyBroker, you can easily develop and fine-tune trading rules, build powerful ML models, and gain valuable insights into your strategy&#x27;s performance.<p>Some of the key features of PyBroker include:<p>- A super-fast backtesting engine built using NumPy and accelerated with Numba.<p>- The ability to create and execute trading rules and models across multiple instruments with ease.<p>- Access to historical data from Alpaca and Yahoo Finance.<p>- The option to train and backtest models using Walkforward Analysis, which simulates how the strategy would perform during actual trading. The basic concept behind Walkforward Analysis is that it splits your historical data into multiple time windows and then &quot;walks forward&quot; in time in the same way that the strategy would be executed and retrained on new data in the real world. Walkforward Analysis also helps overcome the problem of data mining and overfitting by testing your strategy on out-of-sample data.<p>- More reliable trading metrics that use randomized bootstrapping to provide more accurate results. PyBroker calculates metrics such as Sharpe, Profit Factor, and max drawdown using bootstrapping, which randomly samples your strategy&#x27;s returns to simulate thousands of alternate scenarios that could have happened. This allows you to test for statistical significance and have more confidence in the effectiveness of your strategy.<p>- Support for strategies that use ranking and flexible position sizing.<p>- Caching of downloaded data, indicators, and models to speed up your development process.<p>- Parallelized computations that enable faster performance.<p>- Additionally, I have written tutorials on the framework and some general algorithmic trading concepts that can be found on <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pybroker.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pybroker.com</a>.

Swishjam collects all of the performance related metrics from each of your real users&#x27; experiences as they visit your site (such as Core Web Vital metrics, resource load times, and more), and then makes sense of it for you by giving you intuitive visualizations and actionable insights on where performance bottlenecks exist on your site.<p>The web today is littered with massive javascript files, unoptimized images, and poor resource loading strategies, resulting in slow web sites and poor experiences for end users. We initially set out to solve for the third party javascript that is slowing down sites, however after talking with many users it became clear that there was a larger need helping users improve the overall performance of their entire frontend. While these users agree performance is of utmost importance to their web experience, most simply don’t know where to start to tackle the issue. The existing tools on the market today are complicated, and don’t provide actionable insights as next steps. Swishjam’s goal is to simplify performance and ultimately automatically apply performance improvements to your site on your behalf such as auto-image compression, CDN hosting, and strategically loading your page resources.<p>While there are other options that exist to collect performance metrics (ie: CrUX data - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;crux&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;crux&#x2F;</a>), we want to provide a dead simple, open-source way of collecting and visualizing your performance metrics, and give you actual actionable next steps to improve performance rather than leave it up to you to figure it out.<p>This is an early alpha version, we plan to continue to roll out new monitoring and optimization tools in the coming weeks.

The results are public on <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apirank.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apirank.dev</a>. You can request that we index your own API to the list for free and see how it compares to others.<p>Why we did that?<p>During a YC meetup I spoke with a fellow founder that told me how hard it was to pick the right external APIs to use within your own projects.<p>I realized that most of what we build relies on public APIs from external vendors, but there was no benchmark to help developers compare and evaluate public APIs before picking one.<p>So we decided to do it ourselves. Say hi to apirank.dev.<p>Why ranking public APIs is hard?<p>Automating Public API technical assessment is a tough problem. First, we needed to find all the public APIs and their specifications - mostly OpenAPI files.<p>We used several strategies to find those:<p>- Crawl API repositories like apis.guru<p>- Crawl Github for openapi.json and openapi.yaml files<p>- A cool google dork<p>Those strategies enabled us to gather around ~20.000 OpenAPI specs.<p>Then lies the hard part of the problem:<p>We want to dynamically evaluate those APIs&#x27; security, performance, and reliability.<p>But APIs take parameters that are tightly coupled to the underlying business logic.<p>A naive automated way would not work: putting random data in parameters would likely not pass the API&#x27;s validation layer, thus giving us little insight into the real API behavior.<p>Manually creating tests for each API is also not sustainable: it would take years for our 10-people team. We needed to do it in an automated way.<p>Fortunately, our main R&amp;D efforts at Escape aimed to generate legitimate traffic against any API efficently.<p>That&#x27;s how we developed Feedback-Driven API exploration, a new technique that quickly asses the underlying business logic of an API by analyzing responses and dependencies between requests. (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escape.tech&#x2F;blog&#x2F;feedback-driven-api-exploration&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escape.tech&#x2F;blog&#x2F;feedback-driven-api-exploration&#x2F;</a>)<p>We originally developed this technology for advanced API security testing. But from there, it was super easy to also test the performance and the reliability of APIs.<p>How we ranked APIs?<p>Now that we have a scalable way to gather exciting data from public APIs, we need to find a way to rank them. And this ranking should be meaningful to developers when choosing their APIs.<p>We decided to rank APIs using the following five criteria:<p>- Security
- Performance
- Reliability
- Design
- Popularity<p>Security score is computed as a combination of the number of OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, and the number of sensitive information leaks detected by our scanner<p>The performance score is derived from the median response time of the API, aka the P50<p>The reliability score is derived from the number of inconsistent server responses, either 500 errors or responses that are not conform with the specification<p>The Design score reflects the quality of the OpenAPI specification file. Having comments, examples, a license, and contact information improves this score<p>The popularity score is computed from the number of references to the API found online<p>If you are curious about your API&#x27;s performance, you can ask us to index your own api for free at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apirank.dev&#x2F;submit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apirank.dev&#x2F;submit</a>",story,https://apirank.dev/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
