Want to leave the UK and move somewhere abroad permanently. Very hard to do, especially to another English speaking country, without a degree. Contemplating doing an online degree with Western Governers as it looks like the fastest and cheapest option. I also like the fact you get the vocational quals like Cloud Practitioner at the same time. I have 18 months of professional developer experience but have been coding on and off for a lot of the last decade so think I would be able to do either the software developer or cloud computing degrees without too much trouble. Got some savings so would probably do it full time whilst living in a cheap cost of living country, probably in South East Asia, then heading onwards to Australia once I&#x27;d finished on a Working Holiday Visa and then just taking things as they come.
