The same goes for Youtube, Twitter and Reddit. I find it exciting to read the comments and follow the conversations.<p>Unfortunately, not many websites enable people to leave comments. Some of them filter and control what people are allowed to say (e.g. reviews).<p>So I thought it would be great to be able to comment on any website. My solution was to create a browser extension that does exactly that.<p>The extension shows up as a small icon on the side of the webpage. It can be expanded so that you can leave your own comment, and see what other people have said.<p>I do care about privacy. The extension only uses the URL of the current website, and it does not track any of your activity. Moreover, the comments you make are completely anonymous.<p>I would love to hear your opinion about this!",story,https://everycomment.top/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Disclaimer: English is my second language and I am not an expert in AI, just an opinion.<p>Why I love AI - I have no doubt that AI is the future and the future is here. AI has the potential to generate massive wealth for millions of people regardless of their location.<p>Why I hate AI - I am afraid of what will come out of AI if applied wrongly. For example, I love ChatGPT and I use it everyday from drafting letters, learning and more but at the same time I feel the more I use ChatGPT the dull I become (I hope we don&#x27;t become robots one day). I can&#x27;t think about solving something without opening a link to ask ChatGPT. In some way I feel like the same way Social media has had both good and bad, AI may bring both sides too... though the bad side may be more dangerous mentally compared to Social media (just an opinion, every good thing has the bad sad).<p>Finally, if you have time to build AI solutions or learn please don&#x27;t miss this big opportunity. Just be a good person to yourself and others. I am equally trying to see how my small business can use AI to improve our processes.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
