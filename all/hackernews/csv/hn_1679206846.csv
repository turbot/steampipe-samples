35216298,Ask HN: Why is running OpenMPI inside Docker getting sporadiously slow?,2023-03-19T05:24:42Z,gauss82,1,false,false,,,,,,"I am looking at a legacy code here which is first creating a docker container with cgroups (already disabled this, same behavior), which then run MPI jobs inside the docker container. It&#x27;s fast 70% of the time, but sometimes MPI_AllReduce etc. are really getting slow, 2x up to 10x slower performance hit.
Please do not tell me it&#x27;s a bad idea for using docker&#x2F;k8s for HPC&#x2F;MPI, trust me, I know that... :)
Still, I would really like to understand why docker seems to interfere from time to time here and is killing the performance.<p>Thanks in advance to all techies out there which might bring me on the right track.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
