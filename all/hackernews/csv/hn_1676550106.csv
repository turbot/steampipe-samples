The idea behind using a graph is that the information is precisely sorted and categorized. The crawler should understand if the page is, for example, a general article, tutorial, curiosity, or tips&amp;tricks and assign a link to the right node. It should also understand the context and distinguish an article on security where you mention javascript from a javascript course where you mention security and put them in different places. Do you think it is possible? I was looking for existing solutions but couldn&#x27;t find any. Anyone wants to help me with building one?
