Here is an example of what the SQL query generated by the buildQuery function might look like:

By providing additional analysis and explanation, encouraging the manager to consider other factors, and helping them to identify potential biases, the company can support the manager in making more informed and evidence-based decisions.<p>Ionut Georgian Ciobanu
should we fire the manager if her decisions consistently cost the company money and she still ignores the data?<p>Whether or not to fire a manager whose decisions consistently cost the company money and who ignores data is ultimately a decision for the company to make. However, there are several potential factors that the company should consider before making a decision about the manager&#x27;s future with the company. Some of these factors could include:<p>The manager&#x27;s overall performance: In addition to the manager&#x27;s decisions about data, the company should also consider their overall performance as a manager. If the manager is consistently making poor decisions that are costing the company money, but they are otherwise a strong and effective leader, the company may decide to provide additional support and guidance to help them improve their decision-making skills.<p>The company&#x27;s culture and values: The company should also consider its culture and values when deciding whether or not to fire the manager. If the company values data-driven decision making and the manager is consistently ignoring data, their behavior may be out of alignment with the company&#x27;s culture and values. In this case, the company may decide that it is best to let the manager go.<p>The potential impact on the team: Before making a decision about the manager&#x27;s future with the company, the company should also consider the potential impact on the manager&#x27;s team. If the manager is well-liked and respected by their team, their departure may cause disruption and morale issues. In this case, the company may decide that it is better to work with the manager to improve their decision-making skills, rather than firing them.<p>The availability of suitable replacements: Finally, the company should also consider whether there are suitable replacements available if the manager is fired. If the company does not have anyone else who is capable of filling the manager&#x27;s role, it may be better to work with the manager to improve their decision-making skills, rather than firing them and risking",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I don&#x27;t even remember how many services using this gmail as recovery email address or for verification. I am switching to a pure iCloud solution to go forward, but I still want to recover my gmail account and update all online services registered with this email. I have researched online, and found no solution. BTW, I also got a new laptop and returned the old one :&#x2F; which probably made things worse. Please help me if you have any tips.
