A tool that can transform your quick notes in native language into clear International English is going to have a wide audience, and it ain&#x27;t a bad thing IMO. So it&#x27;s not surprising that I&#x27;m now receiving a huge amount of communication from worldwide collaborators and contacts in &quot;ChatGPT voice&quot;. But what I don&#x27;t understand is how we should move past it. It&#x27;s one thing to fill out a bureaucratic form with LLM. It&#x27;s another to initiate a deep conversation with one. And although it may feel better than writing a messy email full of grammatical errors, my reaction after just a few days of being on the receiving end of GPT-4&#x27;s spasmodic ramblings is... no! Give me your error filled notes in whatever language you think I might understand. I want humanity and originality. I may be an old guy but I too have sent thousands of prompts at the oracle and I know it&#x27;s soulless ring as well as anyone.<p>What next? Are people going to realize that they have to spice it up and add a human element back in or risk getting ignored? If your notes were good enough for ChatGPT, maybe they are also good enough for your human collaborator? Will there be a wave of effort to rehumanize communication? What are folks going to do to stand out? Curious what y&#x27;all think.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
