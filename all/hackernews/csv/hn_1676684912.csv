34842955,Ask HN: Chrome extension to summarize YT videos while browsing?,2023-02-18T01:36:37Z,ginkoutest,1,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;ve worked at YouTube since 2020 and saw an explosion of viewers come onto the platform, but also an explosion of critiques and criticisms. The main gripes are that the algorithm serves poor recommendations, and that videos are too click-baity &#x2F; filled with fluff (given the 10-min video length requirement for monetization).<p>Considering these issues, would anyone use a Chrome extension that would allow them to hover over a YT video thumbnail and see a summary of the video transcript? The user could then choose to either watch the video (based on the summary) or dislike it. This makes it easier to bulk dislike videos and tune your algorithm without investing several minutes to click a video, wait for the ads to be done, see the intro, then dislike, click back, and restart your browsing experience.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
