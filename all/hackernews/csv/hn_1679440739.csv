I&#x27;m 17, I&#x27;ve loved computers since I was 5. I&#x27;m a pretty decent programmer, I&#x27;ve done some big projects, worked with teams on extended projects, and have a pretty decent understanding of programming&#x2F;linux&#x2F;networking&#x2F;security&#x2F;etc. I generally write C, Rust, Python, and TS. I attend a STEM school that specialises in CS and engineering, and I&#x27;m in my first year of A Levels (UK) studying Maths, Further Maths, Physics, and Computer Science. I&#x27;m on track to get As and A*s.<p>The plan 6 months ago was - get good grades, go to a good uni, get a CS degree while doing programming to pay for uni&#x2F;do a degree apprenticeship, and go into a CS career. Without LLMs messing the world up, I think it&#x27;s a pretty good plan. I&#x27;m a good programmer for my age and I&#x27;m academic.<p>However, with recent developments, that seems borderline foolish. I&#x27;m interested in physics and engineering, I think I could enjoy a career in either, and I&#x27;ve still got time to pivot to either. I might be able to write better code than GPT-10 - might - but there would surely be increased competition. I also just don&#x27;t find asking a LLM in the &quot;correct&quot; way and having it spit out code trained on millions of other programmers interesting in the slightest. I worry that actually knowing how to write code without a LLM will go the way of knowing assembly and having intimate knowledge of a computers internals.<p>I&#x27;m frankly tired of hearing about LLMs, but I know that I can&#x27;t just pretend they don&#x27;t exist.  I have less than a year to make a decision on which uni courses I apply to and I don&#x27;t know whether I should abandon a sinking ship or hope it&#x27;s alright and it stops here, as an aid but not something which ruins programming.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people saying &quot;But we&#x27;ll still need to translate client requirements to prompts&quot; - 1. I doubt that&#x27;ll pay well, and while that&#x27;s not my primary motivation it is something to consider before committing myself, 2. I&#x27;m not interested in being a human-bullshit to AI-bullshit translator.<p>And yes, there&#x27;s more to CS than programming, but not in a way that pays the bills. If I pivoted I&#x27;d still write code &quot;The old fashioned way&quot; for fun.<p>So: What do I do? I&#x27;d appreciate some advice.<p>Thanks :)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
