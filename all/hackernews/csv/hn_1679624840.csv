It&#x27;s grown from a startup into a big corporate company. I&#x27;ve managed to find my way inside the company, creating unique roles for myself and working on smaller growth initiatives. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the environment less and less as time has gone by, but I still felt there were valuable things I could do inside the company, especially with my knowledge as an early employee. Plus, they paid me well, the culture was mostly good, etc.<p>I recently got laid of which initially felt like a slap in the face. Once I caught my breath and started looking at options at other companies, I&#x27;ve realized how much more excited I am about joining a new small company than I am about anything I could have done at my old company.<p>I tried really hard to make myself happy the best I could inside that company, but it feels like a fresh of breath air realizing that my potential opportunities are much broader than that one company. It almost feels like Stockholm syndrome or something.<p>Anyway, I know I&#x27;m privileged to get laid off and be able to easily find a new job, but I just wanted to share in case anyone else is feeling the same way I was: trapped inside a company that I liked less and less over time.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
