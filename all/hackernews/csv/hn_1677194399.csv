At the end of the day he comes home with the list &quot;Morgan wants infinite deathmage...&quot; and starts drawing.<p>But neither he, his friends nor I have every got into trading card games, any of the gamut from pokemon to magic the gathering.  So the cards are great but the game is dull, basically just rock&#x2F;paper&#x2F;scissors.<p>I know some will say the meta game of r&#x2F;p&#x2F;s is infinitely deep,
but what I really would like your help with is an intro to how trading card&#x2F;deck games work. I can go online and read the rules of game X, but I&#x27;m turning to you, who have the perspective of deep investment of many years in multiple games, to ask what captivated you, and with that perspective what general architecture patterns have you come to see? what makes them fun for you, and what basic ideas he can think about introducing that make choices and strategy interesting without making the rules too complex for kids to understand?<p>Thanks<p>m.c.t",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Obviously, users would want assurances that these personalized models wouldn&#x27;t be shared with anyone outside of the organization, but Microsoft has enough credibility that I think many businesses would try it in hopes of enhanced productivity.<p>Is it because it would be cost prohibitive? Maybe it only makes sense to fine tune a model if there are at least N users in the organization. Anyway, curious if anyone here has insights into this.

However, after a surge in sales during the Christmas and New Year period, Stripe asked for verification on my account, which was previously verified in 2019. I provided all the necessary documents as requested, but Stripe then placed a 25% reserve on all sales for 120 days.<p>To my disbelief, the very next day my Stripe account was locked with a message stating that they could not support my business, and I was unable to contact support through my account. Since then, our business has been severely impacted, and Stripe is withholding over $15,000, which is affecting our ability to pay our bills and buy food.<p>Despite multiple attempts to seek assistance from Stripe, their auto-reply emails from employees in India have provided no justice, and their replies are short and dry with no explanation. As a result, I am now seeking help from anyone who can offer assistance as we are in dire need of the locked funds to support our family and business.<p>If you have any information or can provide assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.
