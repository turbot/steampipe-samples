And then they decode that embedding with attention layers. The &quot;attention&quot; here is like a fuzzy key-value lookup to determine which words go together.<p>And both ChatGPT and DALL-E make the same mistakes here. Mistakes that no human would make.<p>If you ask ChatGPT to &quot;write a funny story about the medieval princess miyu&quot; it&#x27;ll actually do &quot;write a story about the funny medieval princess miyu&quot;. If you ask DALL-E to generate a &quot;black and white photograph of a green orange in the jungle&quot; it&#x27;ll generate pictures of a &quot;green orange on top of black and white jungle&quot;. What that shows is that the attention layer cannot distinguish between &quot;funny&quot; as an attribute of the story vs. &quot;funny&quot; as an attribute of the person inside the story. Or similarly, between &quot;black and white&quot; as an attribute of the image vs. as an attribute of the jungle.<p>Both AIs are lacking the ability to distinguish between multiple objects. My guess would be because the entire text is temporarily merged into one embedding space.<p>In line with that, both ChatGPT and DALL-E also cannot count. DALL-E &quot;photo of twelve oranges&quot; will almost never show 12 oranges. And ChatGPT &quot;count the number of A in &quot;BIKLDJJ34c2424v2bv43v2c3xwbves4b5bLSKJ&quot;&quot; will return random numbers if you ask it multiple times.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
