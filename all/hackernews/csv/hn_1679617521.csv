Thanks to both the creator and commenter there for the idea.<p>This adds another &quot;twist&quot;, in that if you run the &quot;take the wheel&quot; version, it&#x27;ll automatically implement the changes (i.e. overwrite a file with whatever GPT spits out) and show you the git diff. This is obviously potentially unsafe - you&#x27;re overwriting your files with whatever the LLM spits out, so please be careful and don&#x27;t run it somewhere with important files, or in a repo with files you wouldn&#x27;t paste into the chatGPT input box. I wouldn&#x27;t even install this on a work computer.<p>This is pretty basic and isn&#x27;t necessarily all that useful for real work, the workflow is make request -&gt; send file(s) -&gt; GPT changes one file. There&#x27;s no way to continue a conversation, or ask it to make multi-file changes etc. It&#x27;s fun to play with though!",story,https://github.com/hpthomas/GPT_take_the_wheel,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
