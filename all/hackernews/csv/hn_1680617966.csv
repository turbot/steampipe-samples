I am Antoine and with my cofounder Alberto, we got sick of how many meetings we had to attend. So we started interviewing hundreds of team lead, PM’s, CSM’s and tried to understand why they spend so much time in meetings.<p>We boiled it down to three problems:<p>- Bad meeting culture, i.e. not having an agenda, goals, or timekeeping, leading to boring meetings with low engagement.<p>- No meeting documentation, leading to action items and decisions being forgotten and endlessly discussed.<p>- Convoluted company structures, leading to a lot of status updates and information choke points.<p>We iterated on designs to solve each problem and finally presented 3 in our PH launch last month.<p>- A meeting facilitator, keeping time and agenda.<p>- A meeting notetaker, writing action items and meeting summaries.<p>- A “silo destroyer”, answering any question about previous meetings in the organization.<p>To our surprise, over 60% of the people were most excited about the meeting notetaker. We thought those functions were probably already well done by otter.ai, fireflies.ai and co. (turns out, no. (don’t get me started on how terrible of an experience these meeting bots are))<p>So we built an extension for google meet, with clear action items, decisions, and summaries that are time-linked to the transcript and audio. (you can try it here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rb.gy&#x2F;1khoq"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rb.gy&#x2F;1khoq</a>)<p>Basically, I’d like to know your concerns with using such a tool and who you’d need to convince to start using it.",story,https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/record-summarize-your-mee/mclnbcicnofcigjhhilajljjpgepbijp,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

One of the goals was to have a team of expert assistants for every aspect of daily and professional life.<p>These apps are grouped in different categories such as Writing, Learning, Lifestyle, Marketing, Selling, Working, Publishing and Programming. We&#x27;ve tried our best to make it as easy as possible to navigate and use the various apps (one of the goal was that my grandmother could use it...). This AI platform is designed to be easily accessible and user-friendly, eliminating the need for technical knowledge or experience to use it.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works:<p>1. Start by navigating to the app that will best address your current need.<p>2. Then input your data in the chat. Whether you&#x27;re wondering how to cook a romantic diner, write a blog post, create a sales script, or debug code, the fine-tuned AI will give you an answer on point.<p>3. To provide tailored answers, it does not hesitate to ask you more questions to perfectly identify your needs.<p>4. And in a few seconds, you have the perfect solution to all your little problems of everyday life and work that ruin your days. (Well at least we try haha)<p>In addition, it keeps track of your latest interactions so that they are not lost when you switch apps or close the window unintentionally.<p>All interactions history is kept on your own device so that your data is always in your possession, somewhere you have full control over it.<p>I agree like a lot of you that new AI apps come everyday and are seen as an easy cash-grab. My take on current AI apps market is that most &quot;over-specialized&quot; tools are bringing confusion to general public.<p>Instead, we try to aggregate every useful AI apps (and models) on a single platform. Why pay for mutliple AI tools that you will use maybe once in a while when you can have the most useful gathered on the same platform with consistant user experience.<p>This fully-functional preview version of IKiBlast is still a text-based generative AI platform, but more developments are on the way. A text-to-image is already there and soon for educational purposes and it will enable text-to-voice, and voice-to-text interactions, making it even easier to use AI.<p>We tried our best to focus on the democratization and the accessibility of the platform. English-speaking users should not have the monopoly over AI. No one should be left behind, that&#x27;s why we made it available in 6 languages for (we plan to improve the translation) and others will come soon.<p>We would love to have your thoughts and your feedbacks to improve the platform.<p>If by chance you connect to it, do not forget that it’s also targeting general audience.",story,https://www.ikiblast.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
