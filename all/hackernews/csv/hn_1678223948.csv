Darksky no longer functions as a standalone service&#x2F;product as it was purchased by Apple. It was mentioned we can utilize the darksky functionality through the new iOS weather app.<p>I recently updated my iPhone 8 to new iOS and among other things was very much looking forward to the “map view” of weather - which I formerly would access through darksky’s website.<p>In the iOS weather app I can see a map tile showing weather. But when I tap on this tile to view a full-size map view the weather&#x2F;precipitation overlay does not work.<p>It shows a map but no precipitation overlay for my region.<p>Is anyone else having similar issues?<p>Mostly posting this in frustration because a service that used to work perfectly is now not functional at all - despite doing what Apple wants me to (use the app they provide).<p>It’s possible this is due to an older device but it seems like a software issue more than a hardware issue.<p>For the most part I now use ventusky to view weather map data. It would be nice if the iOS weather app worked as expected, though.<p>Any thoughts or tips are appreciated cheers.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
