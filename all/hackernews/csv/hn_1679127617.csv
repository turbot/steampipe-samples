35206977,Ask HN: Strategies to handle RAW photo libraries,2023-03-18T07:34:49Z,krumbie,1,false,false,,,,,,"I would like to improve the way I store and view my photo library. It consists of 15 years of RAW photos, about 2TB or so in size and growing.<p>My current backup &quot;strategy&quot; is having a NAS with two mirrored HDDs, but this feels more and more dangerous. It only needs one incident and everything is gone. I would love to have an automatic backup over the internet, because I know I&#x27;m not going to do it if it&#x27;s too manual. But I don&#x27;t know if there are cost-effective solutions for these amounts of data out there. Dropbox and icloud max out at 2TB for example.<p>The other part of my problem is that I want my photos to be more easily viewable, they are not supposed to rot on a disk. I love scrolling through my iPhone photos, but it&#x27;s more difficult with RAWs. I have an older Lightroom and a newer CaptureOne catalog. I edit many if not all of my photos, so my workflow has to include these tools. In 99,9% of cases there&#x27;s just one edit variant of a given photo, so mostly exported jpgs would map 1:1 to the RAWs.<p>In the end I would like my photos to be easily viewable on the go and searchable (by content ideally). The way I currently do it is to export jpgs into a folder ingested by the Photos application, which merges them into my icloud library. That&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s the native experience on my iPhone and apple&#x27;s servers are much faster than a connection to my NAS, but it also feels like a solution without a lot of freedom. Also, not all photos are equally important (I usually tag with a good&#x2F;neutral&#x2F;bad, not a star system), but I have no way currently to filter on my phone between keepers and other photos. I want to have all available, but would like to be able to hide non-keepers unless I specifically ask for them.<p>There are many aspects of designing this system going forward, and I would appreciate any input how you deal with this. Please refrain from radical suggestions like &quot;just shoot jpg&quot; or &quot;print the important photos and throw away the rest&quot;. I know about all of these lifestyles but I&#x27;m generally happy with my own, it just needs polish.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
