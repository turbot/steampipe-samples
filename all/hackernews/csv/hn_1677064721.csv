34893805,Ask HN: How do you send email verification code to your users?,2023-02-22T10:24:47Z,yvbbrjdr,1,false,false,1,[34893945],,,,"As I&#x27;m developing a social media app, I need to verify my users by sending them a verification code via email. After researching various options, I chose to use AWS SES due to their low cost and relatively low development effort. However, just before our launch date, my production access request got denied, and I felt frustrated and confused.<p>In my request, I provided my use case, which is sending verification codes only when users request them. I also included a template of the email I planned to send, the number of emails I would send per day, and some general statements about how I would handle bounces, complaints, and unsubscriptions. However, the rejection letter I received from AWS was vague, and they stated that they couldn&#x27;t provide specific details for security purposes.<p>Upon further investigation, I realized that sending emails is more complicated than I initially thought. For example, preventing bounces is essential, and this requires using a third-party service that verifies whether an email address exists. However, this won&#x27;t completely prevent bounces. I believe AWS SES rejected my request because they thought I lacked sufficient knowledge and didn&#x27;t want me to contaminate their IP pool.<p>However, my concern is that there are more traps than just bounces when it comes to sending emails. I couldn&#x27;t find any useful resources that could teach me how to do it correctly and which service is the best. Therefore, I&#x27;m seeking advice from the community.<p>What email sending service do you use, and what steps do you take to ensure email delivery success while minimizing bounces and complaints? Any advice would be much appreciated!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
