I copied all stories as-is, and manually picked one of the 4 options stable diffusion gave me for the image generated by &quot;a children&#x27;s book illustration of &lt;prompt from ChatGPT&gt;&quot;.<p>Separately I asked it to generate the HTML template for the site, pick a font, write the about page and come up with a creative &lt;meta&gt; description. Even the PHP script to redirect the user to a random story was written by ChatGPT. (see &#x2F;chatgpt.png for my conversation with ChatGPT relating coding the site). Only minor tweaks were needed.<p>I got the project done in one evening. Crafting the prompt to make the stories (see &#x2F;prompt.txt) took most of the time (still not perfect), together with registering the domain name and setting up SSL (Hetzner). In the end I only had to tweak the html&#x2F;css&#x2F;about parts of the project a little bit.<p>Of course the stories lack some depth and the images are not of the highest quality. But it works and I could not have done this in one evening a few weeks ago. This makes me wonder what would be possible to achieve in one evening 3&#x2F;6&#x2F;12 months from now.
