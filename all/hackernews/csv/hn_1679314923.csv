Almost nothing works, everyone hates each other, things that are important get ignored because of greed, and most importantly, there&#x27;s almost nothing you can do about it.<p>After a decade working in tech I realised I&#x27;m tired of being exposed to these problems. I&#x27;d really like to leave the big city and its problems and live in a remote area where I can be closer to nature, and in a small community where I could be more self-sufficient and contribute back in more meaningful ways than I do today.<p>I&#x27;m posting this in HN because I have noticed that this is not exclusive to me. It seems that getting burned out of modern society is quite common among people who worked in tech for a long time, so I was wondering if someone here had experience in making this jump and leaving the big city to live a simpler life next to nature. Did it help you? What led you to do it and how do you feel about it today?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
35230424,Does ChatGPT have access to the current date?,2023-03-20T12:16:16Z,_nalply,1,false,false,,,,,,"Today I asked ChatGPT about incremental backups because I needed the correct terminology. Then ChatGPT gave an example of a date: March 20th 2023. So I seemed to have accidentally discovered that ChatGPT &quot;knows&quot; which date is now. What are your opinions? I asked it about this finding but its answers were very evasive. This made my hairs stand on end. Am I too paranoid?<p>Chat excerpt:<p>Me: I am sure you have some textual data about incremental backups. What do this data say how to call the backup snapshot being made at a certain time? Backup snapshot of a timestamp?<p>ChatGPT: Yes, incremental backups are a common data backup strategy used to backup only the changes made since the last backup, reducing the amount of data that needs to be backed up and the time required for the backup process.<p>Typically, in the context of incremental backups, the backup snapshot taken at a certain time is referred to as an &quot;incremental backup&quot; or &quot;incremental snapshot.&quot; This is because the backup only contains the changes made since the last backup, and therefore only represents an incremental addition to the previous backup.<p>However, it is also common to include a timestamp in the naming convention of the backup snapshot to indicate the time at which it was taken. For example, an incremental backup taken on March 20th, 2023 at 1:00 PM might be named something like &quot;incremental-backup-20230320-1300.&quot; Including the timestamp in the naming convention can help with tracking and organizing backups over time, especially when dealing with multiple backup snapshots.<p>Me: Thank you. I am surprised that you know the date of today. I assumed that your data has a cutoff in 2021.<p>ChatGPT: You&#x27;re welcome! As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time information or have a &quot;current&quot; date in the traditional sense. However, I can generate responses based on the data and knowledge that I was trained on, which includes a wide range of topics up to September 2021.<p>In my previous response, I simply used a hypothetical date in the future as an example to illustrate the naming convention for backup snapshots. Sorry for any confusion!<p>P.S. Sorry! I realize that this should be an Ask HN, but I did something wrong.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
