Shahar and Tal from Keep here.<p>We&#x27;re thrilled to announce that we&#x27;re open-sourcing our alerting CLI tool, Keep (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keephq&#x2F;keep"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keephq&#x2F;keep</a>). Designed by developers for developers, Keep streamlines and simplifies alerting, making it a first-class citizen within the development process.<p>Think of Keep as Prometheus Alertmanager but for all observability tools, with a simple and intuitive (GitHub actions-like) syntax.<p>We believe that alerting has historically been neglected in existing monitoring platforms, leading to subpar alerting practices. With Keep, we aim to change that.<p>Although it&#x27;s still in its early stages, we would love to get your feedback on our project.<p>Keep provides the following key features:<p>1. Declarative alerting that can be easily managed and versioned in your version control and service repository.<p>2. Alerts from multiple data sources for added context and insights.<p>3. Freedom from vendor lock-in, making it easier to switch to a different observability tool if needed.<p>Some of the features we plan to add in the future include:<p>- Integration with CI&#x2F;CD processes to simplify alerts maintenance and testing.<p>- Scoring system to assess the alert&#x27;s urgency and provide relevant information.<p>- Slack integration to keep track of alerts over time.<p>- More providers, conditions, and other enhancements.<p>We invite you to give Keep a try (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keephq&#x2F;keep"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keephq&#x2F;keep</a>) and share your thoughts with us.
