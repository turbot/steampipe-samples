It&#x27;s kind of like an &quot;analyst in a box&quot; but maybe a bit rougher around the edges. Most folks don&#x27;t want to write SQL. Most folks know how to use slack. Putting a natural language interface onto your data warehouse and exposing it through slack felt like a cunning plan...<p>We built this to get a better feeling for what is possible with LLMs. Other libraries like GPT Index and LangChain provide nice primitives for building apps such as this, but &quot;full&quot; examples are scarce. If the community is interested in the direction we&#x27;re going, we have some more todos listed in the README and welcome feedback.<p>Currently this is more proof-of-concept than production. The README.md on github goes into more detail around what tech choices we made and what the current functionality is. You should be able to read the readme and get a good idea how these kinds of apps work. Unfortunately, deployment is more involved that we&#x27;d like it to be because it connects so many different services: Slack, OpenAI, a relational db, and a datawarehouse.",story,https://github.com/mcminis1/baldrick,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
