I&#x27;ve noticed that nonprofit or political organizations typically have almost no budget and overstretched staff. To make matters worse, many political organizations (in the US) are technically 527 organizations if they are partisan, which makes them unqualified for most nonprofit pricing.<p>It seems that EVERY SaaS is hell-bent on per seat licensing, which has the effect of knee-capping these organizations so only core-staff can afford tools, and no one else has access to what they are working on. Self-hosting and full administration doesn&#x27;t work, because they don&#x27;t have the staff for it. Also you&#x27;d need to engineer the different parts to meet the needs of the organization.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this problem a great deal, and what I want to know is this: Are there any groups working on making organizational operations easier to deploy?<p>What I&#x27;m imagining is something like the free software foundation, but specifically focused on figuring out best practice solutions using open source software to solve common operational use cases. I know about Apache OpenMeetings, Big Blue Button, etc. These are applications, I&#x27;m talking about a more turnkey approach to how the entire organization would run, including all of the applications required.<p>Like mail-in-a-box, but organization-in-a-box. I&#x27;m imagining a omnibus server that can be deployed easily to a cloud provider and meets the needs of most organizations. Like a kubernetes helm &quot;deploy organization&quot; after filling out a small set of inputs.<p>Are there any organizations working on anything like this? Seems like there&#x27;s a HUGE need for this and it could really do some good.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
