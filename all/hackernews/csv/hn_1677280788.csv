34931456,Ask HN: Does 'cheap' offshore (non-NA) talent exist?,2023-02-24T23:04:26Z,jayemery,1,false,false,,,,,,"Since the pandemic forced so many software developers to work remotely, it seems remote work has become much more accepted (though some companies are still fighting against it). For example, before the pandemic, my company wouldn&#x27;t have thought of hiring contractors from agencies based in countries that would prohibit devs from coming into the office. But now we embrace it as part of our culture.<p>However, with so many embracing remote work, I think there are more global opportunities than ever before, and so available local talent is harder to come by, which means salaries are increasing at an arguably unsustainable pace. This is great for developers, but makes it harder for businesses to afford, thereby pushing some businesses to explore offshore&#x2F;nearshore hiring.<p>Unfortunately, the challenge doesn&#x27;t end there. For example, the cost of living for many Eastern European countries is many times less than in North America, yet the cost of hiring developers in these countries can be the same or more than what you might pay for local talent. I&#x27;ve recently reviewed a number of candidates from agencies based in Bulgaria, Poland, and Ukraine - all of which are looking for ~10k USD&#x2F;month for mid-level developers (3-5 years experience). These rates kill the viability of outsourcing, leaving us right where we started.<p>Have you found talent in non-North American regions for an amount of any significant savings? Thanks for reading, I&#x27;m really curious to know your perspective&#x2F;experience!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It gave a VERY reasonable answer to a question that, AFAICT, has never been asked before and one I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be able to necessarily piece together just from the words in existing docs on the internet.<p>Any good pointers that would help me (and I&#x27;m sure others) understand this better?  Most of the stuff I&#x27;ve seen is either too basic (some probability of the next word) or so deep into the guts that its hard to understand intuitively what&#x27;s happening.<p>==========================================<p>Prompt: What if basketball required the ball to bounce at least once before rebounding.  How would that impact the benefit of height in the game?<p>Response: If basketball required the ball to bounce at least once before rebounding, it would significantly impact the benefit of height in the game.<p>Traditionally, height has been a significant advantage in basketball, particularly when it comes to rebounding. Taller players have an easier time grabbing rebounds, both on the offensive and defensive end of the court, since they can reach higher and cover more ground. However, if the ball had to bounce before a rebound could be made, the benefit of height would be greatly reduced.<p>Requiring the ball to bounce before rebounding would increase the importance of timing and positioning over height. A player with excellent timing and positioning could still grab rebounds even if they are shorter than their opponents. In fact, a shorter player with good timing and positioning might be able to get into position to grab the rebound before taller opponents have a chance to react.<p>Additionally, if the ball had to bounce before a rebound could be made, it would also increase the importance of quickness and agility. Players who can move quickly and change directions easily would be better able to anticipate the ball&#x27;s trajectory and position themselves for a rebound.<p>Overall, requiring the ball to bounce before rebounding would make basketball a more dynamic and strategic game, where height is no longer the dominant factor in rebounding. It would give shorter players a greater chance to excel and force taller players to adapt their strategies to the new rules.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

For example:<p>- I don&#x27;t have to make any changes to my dev environment after updating Fedora, whereas XCode command-line tools usually need to be updated manually to get new installs of Erlang &amp; Elixir to pass the compilation stage.<p>- 2x pixel scaling is so atrocious, it literally hurts my eyes on MacOS (at least on my x86 Mac Mini from 2020), while it works perfectly on Fedora.<p>- On MacOS, if I want to completely terminate a program, I have to right click on its icon in the dock and then select quit. On Fedora (and every combination of distribution and desktop env I&#x27;ve tried), clicking the close icon actually terminates the program (imagine that), and no more processes are running unless there&#x27;s still another window running the same program. It seems like GNU&#x2F;Linux follows the Principle of Least Astonishment while Apple does not.<p>GNU&#x2F;Linux in general, and Framework in particular, still need to improve battery reliability and power management. In just about every other way, Apple (with its tightly integrated supply chain and platform) is being upstaged by a disparate network of developers, suppliers, and hardware vendors, none of whom can easily bend the others to their will.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
