A lot has been going on! It&#x27;s been good, bad, amazing and awful over the last couple of years, from COVID and loss, to a new job and so on...<p>I&#x27;ve finally started my dream project and would love to share it with you all. It&#x27;s called The Job Challenge (thejobchallenge.com).<p>The idea is pretty simple. If you complete the challenge, you get interviewed. Completing the challenge proves you&#x27;re capable. The remaining steps are up to the employers. I&#x27;m hoping to be able to cut out a lot of the technical interview process as well as all those spammy emails from recruiters.<p>I thought this project up years ago when I first started looking for a job as a software engineer. I had already been programming for several years before then but found the job-hunting process to be incredibly tedious and painful with arbitrary requirements that made no sense. Coming from a self-taught hobby background with no college&#x2F;uni, I felt that (and discovered later) my resumes were being filtered out long before getting into the hands of an interviewing engineer.<p>I&#x27;m looking to partner with employers that understand the challenges engineers face in this process and who want to save time and money on finding talent.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re an engineer that&#x27;s happy where you&#x27;re at but resonates with the mission, I&#x27;d love to talk. There&#x27;s quite a bit of work to do.<p>Much love, HN &lt;3<p>thejobchallenge.com",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
