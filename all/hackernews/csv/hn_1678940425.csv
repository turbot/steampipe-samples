35177950,Ask HN: How long does it take for you to release your open source project?,2023-03-16T03:51:49Z,buglungtung,1,false,false,,,,,,"I love to build pet projects because it is where I can use anything I want in various ways that I cannot try in my main job. Most of the time, I want to publish them as open source projects, but I haven&#x27;t published any of them. There are too many reasons that make me unconfident to publish them: a lack of documentation because I used all my time on coding, worries about whether my approach is the best practice, concerns about performance because I have not done stress tests, and so on.<p>So, I want to collect statistics on how long it takes for you to release an open-source project from the time you have an idea to the time you announce it on the internet. Then maybe I can plan for myself better.
Thank you so much, guys.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
