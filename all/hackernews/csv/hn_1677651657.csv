Also expensive.<p>I think #4 has a problem with regard to search engine optimizations as both languages would have the same canonical url.  I would like my content to be indexed in both languages.<p>Wikipedia does #1. Apple does #3. Google does both #2 and #4.<p>Question 1) What structure would people here recommend?<p>Question 2) Would it be best to detect the browser&#x27;s preferred language and auto-redirect people, or should I make the user do that language choice manually?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
