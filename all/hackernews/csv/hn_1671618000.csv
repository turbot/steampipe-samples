You can figure Excel out. But it might be for a colleague or a family member, hence this post.)<p>My partner (Lucy) and I have spent this year creating an Excel course. Yes, we chose to enter perhaps the most crowded of markets. We might be idiots. ¯\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>Why? Most Excel courses are ... meh. I&#x27;ve never found one that I loved. And if I see another table of sales figures...<p>At the start of the year Lucy was using Excel as a &#x27;neat grid&#x27; that she could type numbers into. I actually caught her using a desk calculator to figure out her tax. She was then typing the result in to Excel. So she really did start from scratch. Now she&#x27;s VLOOKING-up like a champ and using phrases like &#x27;catching errors&#x27; and &#x27;using the wrong type in an argument&#x27;. This course works.<p>I meticulously planned these lessons. We never talk about a topic that hasn&#x27;t been introduced. No knowledge is assumed. And we were careful never to talk about anything off-camera. Everything Lucy learned, she learned in this course.<p>She likes to learn slowly, so we took it slow. We found many of the online courses were too fast and didn&#x27;t really explain concepts. We start with data types, and then we pull apart the concept of a formula and build one from scratch. There&#x27;s 14 hours of video here, but we figured we&#x27;d rather build the last Excel course you ever need rather than rushing it. It&#x27;s taken me 20 years to get this good at Excel. It&#x27;s not something you can learn in a weekend.<p>There&#x27;s a full money-back guarantee so there&#x27;s no risk, and this link is 50% off just for HN. That makes it just under $US100, or there&#x27;s a 3-month payment plan or a subscription option. (It&#x27;s all hosted on Thinkific, which we love.)<p>Thanks for listening!

But as with all things Javascript, there don&#x27;t seem to be any good resources out there, leaving me completely lost with React and NextJS. Are there any good resources you guys would suggest for taking up the framework?<p>For one, it always seems to be a challenge for me to continue building upon React products. While I could easily flesh out an app solution using Flutter or Swift after learning those two languages, I am not able to create even basic stuff after doing n tutorials with React and NextJS, even though I have done a few pretty okay tutorials from Vercel and the like. I feel it&#x27;s because those tutorials seem less about learning NextJS&#x2F;React concepts and more about building the target product.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
