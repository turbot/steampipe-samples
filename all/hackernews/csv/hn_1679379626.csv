I realized that being able to translate eng-speak to wider audiences was helpful, and I became the go-to resource for sales &amp; success. Want to know how our latest model release affects your customer? Ask me. Want to know the potential downsides of launching a new model to production? Ask me. Will our upcoming product be viable for your prospect? Ask me.<p>I feel like my technical skills like system design have not progressed. I also lack the math background to understand the AI models deeper than input&#x2F;outputs. And lastly, my full-stack programming skills are great for creating fast MVP&#x27;s. But I am not perceived as creating high-quality, readable, maintainable code.<p>I&#x27;m seeking to understand how other people navigate the path of picking new skills to learn.  Any resources or advice would definitely be appreciated!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

What is Apple's strategy?,2023-03-21T06:02:23Z,behnamoh,1,false,false,,,,,,"Apple is known for waiting for technologies to mature so that they can offer them better than the competition. We saw that with large screen iPhones, touch ID, and several iOS features. But Siri and autocorrect in 2023 are as good (read $hitty) as they were a few years ago.<p>I have been using GPT-3 in a shortcut on my Apple Watch and can&#x27;t but wonder what Apple is doing to catch up. I now ask my questions from my own GPT personal assistant instead of Siri and it works much much better.<p>I feel like if Apple doesn&#x27;t say anything about LLMs in WWDC, it will be officially its biggest loss after the death of Steve Jobs.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
