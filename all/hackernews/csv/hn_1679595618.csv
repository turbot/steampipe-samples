Without further ado, the idea for Pawxel was born and I would never have thought, that one year later, the idea I had drawn in my notebook (UI design &amp; some code ideas) would become reality. The intention of this whole project wasn&#x27;t to show it to the public ever, but eventually colleagues and friends told me to do so. I reconsidered my decision to do it closed-source and open-sourced it. There is still a lot to do! Many things I had on my agenda didn&#x27;t found a direct way into the first versions of the application (like Blur, Text recognition etc.) but I think it&#x27;s still enough to have a beta-worthy state.<p>Under the hood the application uses Qt5 and FramelessHelper (a cool library to create a frameless and native window). I think the biggest major changes before there will be any kind of 1.0 is moving to Cmake (eventually, I am in the C++ world for like 8 years and couldn&#x27;t get used to it, don&#x27;t sue me) and to Qt6.<p>Would really like to hear some feedback!
