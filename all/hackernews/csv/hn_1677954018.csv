The problem is that every API call costs money and @mckaywrigley solved it by asking for people&#x27;s OpenAI API Key to talk to the model, which a lot of non-technical people don&#x27;t get. Also, I know you can put a limit on your OpenAI Account so your bill isn&#x27;t astronomical the next day but that kind of defeats the purpose of sharing it online. Hopefully, there&#x27;s a solution but if not I&#x27;ll just ask for API Keys too.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
