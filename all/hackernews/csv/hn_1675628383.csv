The basic setup of the scam is:<p>1. Scammer sets up a fraud site with branding&#x2F;name similar to an established company.<p>Examples: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adverityuk.com, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;applifyrevue.com<p>2. These sites are used to recruit victims for a work-from-home scam and ultimately involve them buying&#x2F;transferring Tether.<p>3. The legitimate company receives complaints when the victim tries to complain or get their money back ultimately damaging the brand&#x2F;business of the company.<p>We&#x27;re unsure of the scope of this scam but we believe it&#x27;s very large as we interviewed victims that lost from USD$15-50K. You can see a warning about this scam at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fenzodigital.com&#x2F;.<p>Many of the scam sites have a reverse IP of 20.232.140.198 and you can see a small sample of the +1000 domains we&#x27;re aware of at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;1tbqtfPi.<p>We believe the host resolves to a CDN based in China (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dnsqx.com&#x2F;gfcdn.html) that is hosted on Azure.<p>We&#x27;ve:
- Contacted the Registrar (Name.com) but they basically said we need to contact the host or work through ICANN.
- Submitted a complaint to the domain registrant through Name.com (no response yet)
- Submitted a complaint to Azure (no response yet)
- Tried contacting the CDN through Telegram (no response yet)<p>Are there any other suggestions for bringing down this scam ASAP?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
