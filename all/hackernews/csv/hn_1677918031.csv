35019139,Ask HN: why does Apple always have better animations?,2023-03-04T08:02:47Z,LangIsAllWeNeed,2,false,false,,,,,,"I have always wanted to keep using android for technical backend reasons.
 But I just find myself “captured” by the  smoothness of the animations and transitions on iPhone, and I always come back. And this hyped assessment is on a fully updated iPhone 7 ,usually with motion effects turned off.<p>I know I could be deluded by marketing but it just seems to me something about the UI and transitions make the phone signinifcantly more appealing and addictive to my impulsive lizard brain.<p>And I wonder whether this factor is underrated in making sense of its dominance. 
 Ecosystem and branding is the obvious likely most important factors, but I think some overlook how appealing the interface is, not just plainly visual, but the response the animation flow gives.<p>Does anyone have a plausible hypothesis for how they do this? Have I been hijacked by marketing?   Does anyone else find apple default apps are just always more smooth?   I really want to use obsidian and standard notes,,, but apple notes always seems to be a couple milliseconds faster or smoother, I just don’t know.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Some get into coding later on life when the need arise e.g: they have to analyse a dataset for some experiment they are doing.
