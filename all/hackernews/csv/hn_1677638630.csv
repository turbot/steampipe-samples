34978115,Ask HN: Is HN (or the world) getting politically extreme?,2023-03-01T02:42:37Z,badrabbit,1,false,false,,,,,,"After ~2016 the US and the europe and elsewhere became more polarized than ever before.<p>But recently on HN and elsewhere I feel like it is impossible to talk politics without blindly consigning all your beliefs to one political extreme or the other.<p>What concerns and frustrated me is the fact that I can&#x27;t imagine and don&#x27;t know of any scenario where a democracy survives where civil discourse is not possible.<p>Is this just in my head or has anyone also observed this? What could be done to improve the situation? I mean, we are living in times when a congressperson calls out for a &quot;national divorce&quot; and hardly anyone bats an eye. I fear the wars and sufferings of the 20th century might pale in comparison to what is arounf the corner if we can&#x27;t disagree and debate in a civilized way.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
