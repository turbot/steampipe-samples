33716596,Show HN: Fastest Python Sandbox,2022-11-23T08:35:06Z,midspectrum,6,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"As developers, we&#x27;ve used StackOverflow, blogs, tutorials, etc to solve our day-to-day code issues and we&#x27;ve been able to find answers to virtually all of our questions. At the same time, CodePen, CodeSandbox, JSFiddle, etc have made it simple to share and execute code for frontend developers but when I look for folks working at the backend side (preferably Python) there is nothing that entices the whole developer community yet. While other Python sandbox solutions are available, they do not provide installation choices or are not intended for embedding and sharing. With this thought, we have built - PythonSandbox.<p>Python Sandbox is a platform built to help Python developers share their knowledge in a manner that is more accessible to consumers. This is expected to help a large community of Python developers, whether they might be backend web developers dabbling with Django and Flask all day long, Data Scientists working on state-of-the-art models using PyTorch and Tensorflow, or Data Engineers crunching huge amounts of data using Spark.<p>With PythonSandbox, you can seamlessly:<p>- Access the underlying libraries and tools that a project uses so that you can see how they work and build on top of them.<p>- Teach, learn and take your Python skills to the next level to demonstrate your projects without setting up a local environment.<p>- Get Better at writing documentation, blogs, and StackOverflow answers to stand out and help the community achieve its development dream.<p>And we&#x27;re just getting started! We&#x27;re big fans of the HackerNews community and we&#x27;re happy to answer any questions and feedback you have.
