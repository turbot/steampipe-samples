35406902,Ask HN: Attack resilience beyond tweaking Cloudflare?,2023-04-02T03:33:21Z,jrvarela56,1,false,false,,,,,,"Today I had my first DDoS attack. It was awesome, I learned a ton! I&#x27;m curious about what else I could look into to level up in this subject (Web Security, Networking, Attacks). These are multiple fields where the HN crowd has great mentors.<p>Here are a few concepts and lessons from today:<p>- Caching: stopping attacks by just making your setup more scalable. In my case this involved leveraging Cloudflare&#x27;s network by ensuring I served everything I could without using my servers. I am aware this comes with troubles not related to security but will skip that to focus the discussion on attack mitigation.<p>- Rate limiting: the frequency with which regular users hit endpoints is likely to be far (1-3 orders of magnitude?) from what a full blown attack would throw at your server. This helps setting aggressive rules on how often someone (as defined by IP, etc&#x2F;metadata) can hit your server.<p>- Simple&#x2F;dumb short-term fixes that wont work even medium-term should be tried: in my case there was one specific url being hit, and I hesitated to set such an easy to bypass rule because my attacker &#x27;would obviously change it once it started failing&#x27;. It ended up stopping the attack... I understand this may not be so clear cut always (hindsight bias, easy fix that could be validated immediately).<p>- Involving more layers of your stack increases you capacity to handle attacks: this sounds obvious but keeping requests from getting to your application becomes easier if you can tweak Cloudflare, tweak your ngnix&#x2F;heroku, and also being able to catch stuff at the application level. Each layer has to deal with an order of magnitude less requests than the one before it, so the attack has to be bigger and bigger the more layers contribute in this dynamic.<p>- Paging is important: as a small company, we hadn&#x27;t put as much thought as would have been good to have today.<p>Got an immersive glimpse of a part of level 0 today and would love to see what paths the HN crowd has taken to learn more about attacks and web security.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35406965,Show HN: Kidcast.fm – personalised audio stories for kids (not AI generated),2023-04-02T03:43:54Z,milchek,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi everyone, long time lurker&#x2F;reader here wanting to share a startup I co-founded.<p>First off, the sales pitch: We are the world&#x27;s first online audio platform that plays stories with your child as the star! Every Kidcast story uses your child&#x27;s name to bring them into the adventure as the main character! Our stories are specifically designed to bring the imagination to life and entertain kids from 2-6 years without screens or distractions.<p>Now that is out of the way, let&#x27;s go into a bit more detail about the product and about us.<p>The idea came from my co-founder, Adam, who would read bedtime stories to his children with them as the main characters (Adam is a childrens book author - which helps). He quickly found that his own kids loved the stories where they featured more than standard childrens tales - little kids are mini narcissists or just fascinated by the idea of being the star of the story.<p>This is what lead him to looking into how a product with personalised audio might work and scale - and that&#x27;s where we were introduced by a mutual friend. I immediately saw the value in the concept after testing with my own children and got to work figuring out how to scale the process of personalising stories that contain sound effect, music and narration with thousands of names.<p>We did look at AI and machine generated content but decided to go down the &#x27;human made&#x27; path for the reasons of performance - to be fair, AI voice modelling has come a long way since then, but we still have more flexibility and control of performance the old fashioned way (for now). Ultimately, we wanted to create content for kids that had some substance and it felt appropriate to not use AI or machine generated voices to get a more genuine product.<p>Our stories are approx 5 mins in length, professionally produced with SFX and music, and we have a catalogue of just over 1,000 names to choose from at the moment. You get 1 free story and we&#x27;re selling the rest as an addon for now - but this may change in future as we add more content.<p>Personally, I found the stories to work really well in the car; as soon as my kids hear their names, they quieten down and listen.<p>Anyway, We&#x27;re just getting started, and this is one of the first public forums I&#x27;ve shared this on. Would love to hear peoples thoughts and feedback and hopefully your own children love the stories.<p>Thanks!",story,https://kidcast.fm,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
