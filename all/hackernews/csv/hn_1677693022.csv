- Sync data from HubSpot and Salesforce into a local Postgres cache and make reads against a normalized CRM schema
- Make writes (POST and PATCH) to HubSpot and Salesforce using the unified API
- Open source MIT license so anyone can self-host for free<p>Today we support reads, creates, and updates for Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities for HubSpot and Salesforce.<p>In the coming weeks, we plan to add more connectors and features like configuring sync frequencies, webhooks for notifications, sync rate limiting&#x2F;throttling. We&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and any feature requests!<p>Give it a try and let us know what you think!

For example, every time you alt+tab there is a weird beep sound, or the computer randomly restarts every 10 minutes, or after 10 minutes in Minecraft the keyboard presses &#x27;W&#x27; for 3 seconds, or I move her mouse remotely and etc... (some are extremely evil, like stopping <i>half</i> the internet 128.0.0.0&#x2F;1 or 0.0.0.0&#x2F;1 every 10 minutes for 3 seconds)<p>I made a whole deck of cards (each prank fits on one playing card): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jackdoe&#x2F;programming-for-kids&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;projects&#x2F;panic&#x2F;cards-small.pdf<p>I sell the decks for 5€ (e.g.: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;punkx.org&#x2F;c-pointer-game&#x2F; or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;punkx.org&#x2F;punk0&#x2F;) but for this one, I am not even sure what kind of lawyer should I talk to, to make sure I am not liable if a user of the deck damages someone&#x27;s computer. I also aded epilepsy warning on the cards that are very visual (like randomly rotating the screen 90 degrees).<p>The deck is also licensed CC BY 4.0, so anyone can re-print it, and are the people printing it and sharing it liable as well? The warning I have now is made by me and you can see it on the first card, but I will also paste it here:<p><pre><code>    WARNING! WARING! WARNING!

Blueprint is a general fine-tuning and model serving API built for developers. Fine-tuning models is an extremely powerful way to improve performance on a specific task without needing to collect prohibitively large amounts of data. With Blueprint you can kick off fine-tuning jobs for various open source models like Stable Diffusion and soon Flan-T5 using a Python SDK.<p>We&#x27;ll also deploy your fine-tuned models onto serverless GPUs so that you aren&#x27;t paying for idle GPU time. We scale the models up when you need to serve requests and have put a ton of engineering work into faster cold starts. We&#x27;ll also autoscale replicas of your model if your model is receiving a lot of traffic.<p>Give it a shot — every new account gets a few hours of GPU credits.
