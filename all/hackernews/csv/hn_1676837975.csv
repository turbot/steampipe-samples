34861327,Ask HN: Can we mount macOS clipboard as a filesystem?,2023-02-19T20:10:30Z,behnamoh,2,false,false,3,"[34861354,34861350]",,,,"In the spirit of this [0] post on HN, I&#x27;m wondering if we can mount the clipboard contents as a drive on macOS. This can be super helpful when a website&#x2F;application doesn&#x27;t support drag-n-drop, but you want to select a screenshot as its input. Normally, you&#x27;d have to take the screenshot, then go to the website&#x2F;app. It&#x27;ll then open the file selector box&#x2F;dialog where you can select the screenshot file. But if the clipboard was mounted as a drive, you wouldn&#x27;t need to save the screenshot anymore—just take it and have it in the clipboard, then go to the website&#x2F;app and select the image in the clipboard drive.<p>0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34847611",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
