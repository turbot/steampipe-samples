You can select a specific text from a website and get its definition, make content based on that, rephrase it, or even make tweets based on the selected text from the website to share on your wall.<p>Also, it supports command base work on the text field of a website. You can easily create content, generate tweets, write code, write mail, rephrase the content, translate content for your customer support, generate more detailed mid-journey prompts, and more without switching the tab.<p>It is an extension that will work on any website.<p>It is still under development and I am almost done. I shared a pre-order offer for early adapters 2 days ago. But no sale yet. So, Should I continue the work or not?<p>Check - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitruo.simplef.net&#x2F;<p>All advice and feedbacks are welcome.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
