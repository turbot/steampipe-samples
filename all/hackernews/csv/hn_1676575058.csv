You can use our drag and drop editor to create visual flows describing how, when, and where customers should receive messages when they complete actions on your site or app.<p>Our tool can be used to design a set of email and sms onboarding messages for users who sign up to your site for example, or to design a drip campaign to nudge users to complete an action like a purchase.<p>We know omni-channel messaging platforms exist (for example braze or iterable) but in our experience, they can&#x27;t be easily self hosted, they aren&#x27;t user friendly, or they are too expensive to get started with or some combination of all the above. We want to build something that&#x27;s open source, easy to self deploy, and user friendly amongst other things. We also believe a true omnichannel platform needs to be open source so anyone can add messaging channels, and integrations to pull product and customer event data.<p>We’ve launched with the MIT &#x2F; AGPL licenses so any developer can use the tool. You can also try our hosted option first if you want to see what its like.<p>In the next few weeks &#x2F; months, we plan to add more messaging channels, improve the UX of our no-code drag a drop tool and add more integrations (especially product analytics and db ones)<p>Give it a try (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;laudspeaker&#x2F;laudspeaker"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;laudspeaker&#x2F;laudspeaker</a>), and let us know what you think!",story,https://github.com/laudspeaker/laudspeaker,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
