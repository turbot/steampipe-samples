This data travels in plaintext, and can be read, but it can&#x27;t be modified in any way!.<p>This library was born as my need to simply sign some data structure to store it in a cookie securely. I had been using itsdangerous for that, but at some point I wanted something simpler, and uncomplicated, so I wrote a couple of lines and got it working using native BLAKE2 in keyed hashing mode, which I then published as a Gist (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;HacKanCuBa&#x2F;b93864a1ed41746b3d75f80eb09de109"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;HacKanCuBa&#x2F;b93864a1ed41746b3d75f80eb...</a>) for others (and me) to use in a copy-and-paste fashion.  
I proceeded to add a few features, tests, and the like, and eventually asked myself: why not create an actual package?. The more I edited the Gist, the more I believed it could actually be more useful as a package, and to be actually installed in projects, just like other excellent libs such as itsdangerous, Django&#x27;s signer, pypaseto, pyjwt, etc.<p>Additionally, this library has good tests, good docs, a nice changelog, automated tests with several Python versions (supports Python3.7+), follows semver, it&#x27;s production-ready, it&#x27;s fast and easy to use... well, I will let you decide that :)<p>Any feedback about it is very welcome! To try it out, just pip install it, and follow any of the shown examples: they are all copy-paste-able ready-to-work.",story,https://blake2signer.hackan.net/en/stable/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We were not best friends, but we know each other from a professional perspective.<p>I am a tech person, mostly behind the scenes. My co-founder is a salesperson, responsible for closing the deals.<p>The company is doing great, I couldn&#x27;t dream of a better fate financially. Deals are flowing, we are both making money, and life felt beautiful unless I recently got to know that my co-founder is stealing money from the company, hence from me. When he&#x27;s closing the deals, he charges clients much more than he tells me and puts that money into his pockets.<p>For example, he negotiates $150 for a deal, brings in $120 to the company (we cover the opex and split the profit as a dividend) and that $30 goes directly to his pockets.<p>He&#x27;s been doing this for over a year, costing me six figures by my estimates.<p>I could potentially sue him and get my money back. But the issue is that if I start a battle with my co-founder the music will soon finish, he will stop bringing in money in the company. I will probably loose all the upcoming profit (MUCH greater than what he steals from me) and other people, that I brought in the company (some of them are close friends) will be affected (if no runaway money, I will be forced to send them to homes).<p>What would be your advise, other than legal battle?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
