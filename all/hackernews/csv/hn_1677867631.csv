What tools do you use?<p>- How do you announce your courses &#x2F; availability?<p>- Are you accepting payment &#x2F; donations and how&#x27;s that working out for you?<p>- Anything else you can share?<p>Background: I can probably set aside some time for, and have some interest in teaching community courses. I&#x27;ve done this in the past in various ways, but this was years ago.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of some simple topics that have been relevant in my community in the past, like intro to AM&#x2F;FM&#x2F;Shortwave radio for emergencies, or let&#x27;s say how to enjoy geocaching. I could get into some more high-demand general topics but want to start simple.<p>I previously taught these kinds of courses as part of a service framework in a religion I was a member of at the time. But now that&#x27;s changed, and I&#x27;ll need to manage the outreach, venue scouting, and scheduling more directly by myself.<p>So, some parts of this seem a bit foreign to me, not having a huge organization at my back anymore. Also I realize things are different since COVID.<p>Thanks for any tips and experiences you can share.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
