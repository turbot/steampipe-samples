34735068,Ask HN: Does a JIT typically use machine learning to boost performance?,2023-02-10T02:53:01Z,Decabytes,1,false,false,,,,,,"I was reading about Dotnet Core&#x27;s Tiered Compilation model and the two requirements to go from Tier 0 to Tier 1 caught my eye.<p>&gt; The method needs to be called at least 30 times, as measured by the call counter, and this gives us a rough notion that the method is &#x27;hot&#x27;. The number 30 was derived with a small amount of early empirical testing but there hasn&#x27;t been a large amount of effort applied in checking if the number is optimal. We assumed that both the policy and the sample benchmarks we were measuring would be in a state of flux for a while to come so there wasn&#x27;t much reason to spend a lot of time finding the exact maximum of a shifting curve. As best we can tell there is also not a steep response between changes in this value and changes in the performance of many scenarios. An order of magnitude should produce a notable difference but +-5 can vanish into the noise.<p>&gt; At startup a timer is initiated with a 100ms timeout. If any Tier0 jitting occurs while the timer is running then it is reset. If the timer completes without any Tier0 jitting then, and only then, is call counting allowed to commence. This means a method could be called 1000 times in the first 100ms, but the timer will still need to expire and have the method called 30 more times before it is eligible for Tier1. The reason for the timer is to measure whether or not Tier0 jitting is still occurring, which is a heuristic to measure whether or not the application is still in its startup phase. Before adding the timer we observed that both the call counter and background threads compiling Tier1 code versions were slowing down the foreground threads trying to complete startup, and this could result in losing all the startup performance wins from Tier0 jitting. By delaying until after &#x27;startup&#x27; the Tier0 code is left running longer, but that was nearly always a better performing outcome than trying to replace it with Tier1 code too eagerly.<p>I understand that a JIT can optimize a running program to produce even more performant code, but in this case the two parameters weren&#x27;t optimized much once a good set of values were found. This makes sense from the perspective of the programmer, but it seems to me that this could be dynamically tuned on a per CPU basis depending on factors like, how good a users cooling solution is, and whether or not they won the silicon lottery.<p>So in this case it does not appear like any machine learning was used to tune these parameters, but a &quot;optimizing ML entity&quot; that had access to these knobs, could potentially use these, and other parameters to tune a given program for your computer in a much more intimate way than currently possible. Is that something that is done with JITS in general? Or is the performance tuning more rudimentary than that?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
