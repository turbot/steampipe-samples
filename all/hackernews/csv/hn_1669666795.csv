I believe browsing Pinterest anonymously was always limited, therefore I pretty much always avoided this site. At some point LinkedIn changed to require a login to view profiles, well most of the time. Maybe this change occurred around the time Microsoft bought them. I avoid LinkedIn too. At some point both Instagram and Twitter also started aggressively limiting content for anonymous users. Medium and Substack have been increasingly nagging and&#x2F;or limiting content too. Spotify seems to be trying to increasingly cross sell podcasts and audio books. Just within the last week they&#x27;ve also made multiple attempts to get me to enable push notifications for various communication. And then just this morning I browsed Indeed to keep an eye on what&#x27;s going on in the local area and found they are limiting search results to one page without logging in. The only one of these I pay for is Spotify, so I guess fair enough, except for Spotify. This certainly isn&#x27;t a comprehensive list. I feel I&#x27;m having to be increasingly defensive. I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m spending more and more time blocking, dismissing or having to give up on sites and services.<p>Is this trend increasing? If so what are some reasons why this is occurring? Is it the changing economy? Because companies dominate the product and so they feel they can get away with it? Because companies grow and lose their first principles?
