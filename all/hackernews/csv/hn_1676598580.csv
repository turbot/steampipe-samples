34829215,Ask HN: Has DDG always rewritten URLs on its non-JS search?,2023-02-17T00:58:29Z,danShumway,1,false,false,1,[34829227],,,,"I&#x27;ve noticed recently that if I use DDG with Javascript turned off, page URLS get rewritten to go through DDG with an ID attached to them. Ex:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;html?q=duckduckgo%20tracking<p>Shows its urls in the format:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.duckduckgo.com%2Fduckduckgo%2Dhelp%2Dpages%2Fprivacy%2Fweb%2Dtracking%2Dprotections%2F&amp;rut=a4221949d4d60ca8654aabbfa5700d5d94369f6481bf45c8ac4d6906fd6d63fb<p>It&#x27;s possible that this has been happening for a while and I didn&#x27;t notice it, but I could have sworn this didn&#x27;t use to happen; I&#x27;ve sold people on using DuckDuckGo by telling them that it didn&#x27;t rewrite URLS. Was I wrong, or is this a newer change?<p>The JS-enabled page doesn&#x27;t change the URL, but it does intercept load events and tries to contact improving.duckduckgo.com. That&#x27;s a more recent change, and one that uBlock Origin already handles I think. URL rewrites I didn&#x27;t know about and are a bit harder to deal with. They&#x27;re also obviously fairly disappointing to see; I&#x27;m not sure how tracking which specific link a user clicks on isn&#x27;t tracking that user, even if the data is &quot;anonymized&quot;.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
