35080233,Ask HN: Why are Windows and macOS upgrades so terribly slow compared to Linux?,2023-03-09T11:24:17Z,capableweb,2,false,false,4,[35080291],,,,"I own a couple of laptops, desktops and servers all running different OSes, some of them dual-booting and some not.<p>When I upgrade Windows, it frequently tells me the upgrade will take ~2 minutes, so I initiate it by rebooting, and after 20 minutes and multiple reboots, it finally gets me to the login, and first login spends ~5 minutes to login. Overall, terrible experience. Download is done in the background before doing the install, so this is just the installation process.<p>When I upgrade macOS, the progress in the beginning is fast until it reaches ~40%, then it stops and basically hangs with no process and might take up to an hour to do an upgrade. Same here as with Windows, download has been done in the background, so this is just the installation process, not including download.<p>Compared to when I upgrade my Linux boxes (most of them using Arch, some NixOS, some (still) on Ubuntu or Debian), the upgrade usually spends most time in the download stage, maybe maximum 10 minutes of installation and then reboot and it&#x27;s done.<p>I recently didn&#x27;t use my workstation that is using Arch for about a month. A huge amount of packages are installed on this as I do a lot of different work, so after a month I had about 40GB worth of updates to download and install. The download took some minutes, it spent some minutes installing all the packages, it spent the longest time recompiling some kernel modules and regenerating the boot images, then I rebooted and was back to work.<p>But it&#x27;s never that fast on Windows or macOS. How come? Why is Linux distributions so much faster? Windows and macOS have huge teams working on them, there must be something I&#x27;m not understanding or missing, because I can&#x27;t see how the experience can be so much worse for these OSes compared to Linux distributions.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
