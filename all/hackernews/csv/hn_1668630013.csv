One of the most important skills for traders is know how to set up stoploss and stick to it when stoploss is about to hit. I see that most crypto traders don&#x27;t follow this principle.<p>On the other hand, there is a segment in fintech called prop-trade challenge. This is a proven business model in forex &amp; stock trading with multiple platforms having 100k+ active users (such as Topstep or FTMO). These platforms evaluate day traders’ performance in real-time simulated accounts, in which those who pass the evaluation&#x2F;challenge earn a funded trading account (while still being monitored against its max drawdown rule).<p>I realized that prop-trade challenge can be integrated with copy-trade functions and create a better version of crypto social trading platform than the current Etoro model. That&#x27;s why I built Tordess (a “misspelling” of tortoise).<p>We launched our MVP (open-beta) on October 15th, acquired 700+ beta users&#x2F;testers as of today and secured affiliate partnership with 2 major Vietnamese crypto trading &amp; prop-trade (Facebook) groups that have more than 200 thousand members.<p>Since launch, several top traders on our platform have produced 100%+ return on simulated accounts, without breaking our rule of maximum 10% drawdown. While it is amazing how talented retail traders are able to achieve such results in crypto bear market, it also shows the potential of fixing social trading (copy-trade) model by combining prop-trade challenges.<p>If you find this interesting, please give Tordess a try. Our competition mode is always for free.<p>Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!",story,https://tordess.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I love remote work, it has given me more flexibility and made it easier for me to be better at work and better at home.<p>However, it has taken a significant and largely unseen toll on my mental health.<p>I am not sure why, I&#x27;m still trying to figure it out, but I have made one key observation. And I&#x27;d welcome either confirmation or denial from this crowd if you&#x27;ve experienced the same.<p>For context, we have shifted largely to using Slack, video call, and email for communication. Slack is the biggest culprit in the whole mess. My biggest takeaway is that text is not lossless compression for communication. Or put another way, text doesn&#x27;t capture the vocal inflection and nuances that communicating by voice does. And also, for some reason, I tend to interpret a written message in a much worse way than I do a message that is communicated verbally.<p>One message on its own is not a huge deal, but across the 100+ channels I belong to and the probably hundreds of messages that come my way in a day, it adds up to a lot of added psychological burden. I think email already had this drawback, but with slack because people are empowered to just fire away a message, less thought goes into it, the frequency goes up, and the psychological toll increases.<p>Does anyone feel the same?<p>Do you have any tips to deal with this?<p>Sometimes I think I&#x27;m a snowflake for thinking this way, and I&#x27;ve definitely had to learn to toughen up during this pandemic working a very stressful job at a FAANG. But it is one of the things I think has made the largest change, as far as a psychological toll goes.<p>Thanks for reading.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Long story short, you call the number and it puts you through around ~3.5 minutes of pre-recorded nonsense only to be told &quot;We&#x27;re sorry, but we have too many calls to help you at this time. Please call back later.&quot; and then hang up on you. Not place you in a hold queue, literally hang up on you. This is not a joke, exaggeration or lie, this is quite real.<p>The thing is, if you get REAL lucky, you MIGHT just make it through to the hold queue after all. There&#x27;s a slight variation in the way the pre-recorded message plays out in the first minute or two if you happen to make it through, but it&#x27;s all based on unknowable and unpredictable call volume from potentially hundreds of thousands of other people all at the same time and the line is only open M-F 8-5.<p>The only way to solve a problem with this agency in my case is to reach a human being with this agency and this is the only way to do it. Problem is, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get into the hold queue. I&#x27;ve called them, brute-force style, over a dozen times over and over again and been hung up on after the pre-recorded crap every single time. The only way to get into the hold queue is to get lucky. Which means I need a way to automate this thing for brute force so I can finally get a human.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve got an iPhone 12. I&#x27;d rather not have to sit here and dial, wait, hang up, dial, wait, hang up, etc. all day long trying to brute force my way into a hold queue to get to a human being, which is unfortunately the only possible way to solve my problem with this particular state government agency.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any programmable phone technology interface that I could use as a one-off to automate my iPhone&#x27;s phone interface for something like this, hence why I&#x27;m asking HN. Would you folks happen to know of a tool I could use for something like this? Doesn&#x27;t need to be anything super formal, certainly not looking to build a product, and it only needs to dial ONE number. It just needs to be able to listen for a pattern and hang up and repeat if it hears that exact same pattern, and if it hears a variation from that, NOT hang up. Ideally something I can script from my MacBook Pro to control my iPhone, then put the thing on speaker while I go off and do more important tasks, like clean the kitchen or something.<p>I&#x27;m chasing down non-technology options (state senator&#x27;s office) but in the meantime, I&#x27;d like to see if there&#x27;s a way I can automate brute forcing my way through their broken phone system.
