33737577,"Warning – Google suspended GCP services for 'verification', lost my business",2022-11-25T00:05:32Z,alirsgp,7,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I operate multiple apps which were providing my entire livelihood, and I wake up one day to realize it&#x27;s all gone.<p>Long story short, Google froze my Google Pay account which is used to pay for anything related to Google services, including GCP. This was done as they need to temporarily suspend me to &#x27;verify&#x27; me. The GCP team couldn&#x27;t help me since it was an issue with Google Pay. Not to mention their chat support is useless and doesn&#x27;t have any power to look into cases.<p>Now I login to find out my Google Pay account is &#x27;temporarily suspended&#x27; since I need to verify my account. I go ahead and add my drivers license and fill out their form, but while they verify details they suspend your ability to pay for any Google services.<p>So now I can&#x27;t pay for GCP usage (firebase) and all my authentication, database, cloud functions, are all not usable since the service is suspended. Unlike Amazon who offers phone lines for resolving billing issues, Google does no such thing. I wish I chose AWS.<p>The end result is that I have apps I spent years of my life building and which currently feed me to only be rendered unusable because some AI at google thought my Google Pay needed additional verification.<p>My whole life has done a 180 in the past week. I feel like I&#x27;m a man with literally nothing to lose and I can&#x27;t live with myself anymore. This hurts much more than losing a job for me.<p>Please stay far, far away from Google services of any kind. They are by far the worst of the big tech companies when it comes to developer support.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Obviously it’s hard to pick winners when the start-up is just starting, but I assume it’s more easy to see who will not make it.<p>I was recently asked to join an app with two others that applied to YC recently (they didn’t get accepted, but were told they were the top 10%).<p>I am nervous to join these two because they are both junior devs and first time founders.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
