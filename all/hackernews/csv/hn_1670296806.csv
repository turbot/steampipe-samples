My bootcamp experience was seemingly rather devoid of tasks - my mentor told me to monitor my calendar as that was where any training I was assigned would show up. None ever did.<p>I joined a team and just went along figuring everything out for myself, kind of surprised that apparently everyone there just had to struggle along like I did. I still managed to get fairly good reviews in most axes, albeit my delivery speed was not what was expected.<p>I kept asking my mentor and my manager if there was some training I could have missed, some &quot;Welcome to &quot; or &quot;Intro to&quot; the company. Neither of them had any idea what I was talking about. I started writing some of my own documentation, because I thought it was so bizarre that there wasn&#x27;t anything they could point me to, everything seemed to be...word of mouth?<p>I continued along, shipping features and volunteering for things. I even shipped a feature that improved a metric by 4.5million [action] per day! I was told this was an example of substantial impact. I was proud of that but still couldn&#x27;t shake this feeling that I had missed something crucial. I kept coming across things that I felt I should not have had to figure out for myself. I started collecting these in my head, and I noticed myself becoming more and more preoccupied with what else I must have missed, because these were things that each would have saved me weeks of searching - tools and processes that people would happen to mention that I had never heard of before, and they seemed to expect me to know about them. When I would ask, &quot;Oh, what was that tool you just named?&quot; They would look at me bizarrely and repeat it and were very confused when I thanked them enthusiastically.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until the second half of my second half that I made a list of Things That I Should Have Been Told (Instead of Having to Find Out For Myself) - for example: what diff tool we use and that submitting a diff automatically marks it ready for review, as opposed to that being a separate step (I was struggling to figure out why my mentor kept commenting on my diffs that to me were still in WIP - at the same time, he didn&#x27;t understand why I kept submitting diffs that were not ready for review - he was using the GUI version, I was using command line...) I had asked, trying not to show my mounting frustration, &quot;Did you guys learn these things somewhere? Or did you just come across them?&quot;<p>Someone on my team was like, &quot;Didn&#x27;t you have bootcamp basics training? You know, like classes and videos?&quot; &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t have any classes. I watched some HR videos but that was it.&quot;<p>I brought it up to my manager, he couldn&#x27;t care less. Nor could HR or anyone else. Apparently I am the only person this has ever happened to and nobody would go so far as to simply acknowledge that yeah, that must have been a frustrating experience, and yeah, it would make sense to then allow me to take the training, to fill in any gaps I might still have that would serve to improve my efficacy and allow me the same opportunity as everyone else.<p>Even with that successfully shipped feature that had impressive impact for a rotational engineer, I did not impress the powers that be.<p>I did not transition to FTE because apparently while I made sufficient progress in the first half, in the second I was too focused on having missed the training and should not have requested access to the training that I never had the opportunity to take. I thought this would amount to... discrimination or something, but I was merely singled out, not a member of a group against whom anyone discriminated.<p>TL;DR: Worked at a FAANG company for a year with no training and still shipped a feature with significant impact - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
