What I like about notion is how its got a wiki structure, and this is where G-Docs leaves us short. The performance of notion also left me unsure, a few too many times looking at a white page for 5-10 seconds waiting for it to load. We will use G-docs for all our documentation, but I often find there is a cognitive load trying to store and file everything, not to mention link it within some sort of ToC. I find G-docs can quite easily end up &#x27;feeling&#x27; messy&#x27; unless you keep constantly on top of it.<p>Another thing of course is GitHub, I feel confident using this for kanban boards, project management etc.<p>There is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youneedawiki.com, but I again I am hesitant to subscribe to another tool yet again, as we are trying to keep things costs lean.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
