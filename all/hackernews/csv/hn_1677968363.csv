  Quite relaxed.
  You are getting sleepy.
  Your eyelids are getting heavy.
  Heavy as lead.
  &#x27;Heavy as lead.
  &#x27;You will try but you can&#x27;t open your eyes.
  ..
  You have forgotten your name.
  &#x27;What is your name? &#x27;

I am on track to be  promoted a &quot;Senior SWE&quot; in the next 3-6 months.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to figure out is, given my current position, age, experience etc, how far can I realistically go, and how do I get there? I work with a lot of people who are 24-28 years old and some of them are &quot;Senior&quot; SWEs, and Principals who are ~30. I don&#x27;t begrudge them, they are smart, focused, and made far fewer mistakes than I did as a young person. I experienced some setbacks in life  and also pursued other interests (being a musician) more seriously than career in my 20s and 30s. But I have around 15 years of full time job experience, and my current role does not really reflect that.<p>Now, I have a family, and I am serious about pursuing seniority and higher earning potential. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the smartest guy in the room, but I have a lot of experience, and am a dedicated and driven engineer.<p>I appreciate your thoughts.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
