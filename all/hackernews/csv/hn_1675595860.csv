I have no way to prove otherwise.<p>Does it matter if an AGI robot is conscious, if it behaves and acts like a normal intelligent human being? Once it passes the &quot;human being like&quot; Turing test, such that there is no way to distinguish a real human from an AGI robot, then the question of consciousness is moot anyway, correct?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
