I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback.<p>widget.json brings a dynamic window to the web to your device&#x27;s home screen. It&#x27;s kind of like RSS for widgets, you make a widget.json for whatever web data you want and then subscribe to it in Widget Construction Set, our iOS widget.json viewer.<p>We&#x27;ve made image of the day and word of the day widgets, Youtube channel widgets that show the latest videos, RSS widgets, Prometheus counter widgets and more. You can imagine a GitHub CI widget showing the last build status with a link to view it. Friend groups could make a shared scratch pad of text and images. Househoulds can make a shared TODO or grocery list widget. Widgets can use local device launch schemes which enables widgets to initiate text messages, calls, emails, shortcuts apps, and more. With this, you can make a widget that shows images of your favorite people and when you tap their image it FaceTimes them. If you&#x27;re worried about Twitter, you could even make your own one-way Twitter replacement where your text and images show up on your followers home screen!<p>Ideally, sites add a widget.json feed alongside their RSS feed. widget.json files have a one-click subscribe link to easily add them to Widget Construction Set. This gives sites and creators a simple, direct connection to their users without the need of building a separate app or having their users remember to visit their site. For Patreon or other user-supported creators, they can offer private widgets that are only granted to their supporters.<p>We couldn&#x27;t figure a way to make a business on this, but we liked what the technology enabled so we&#x27;re releasing it all for free, with the exception of a one-time $2.99 purchase to view private widgets. Though since the widget.json format is open, if $2.99 is too steep, people are free to make their own private widget viewer as well.<p>Widget Construction Set:

33777533,Show HN: Use DALL-E 2 to generate custom wall art,2022-11-28T18:33:17Z,mful,4,false,false,1,[33778080],<null>,<null>,<null>,"The earliest version of this idea came a couple years ago, when I moved into the first place I finally cared enough about to invest in. I wanted wall art that matched my style, but couldn’t find much within my budget. I wanted items that were congruent with my home, and wasn’t really looking for pieces with great stories or that took courage to produce or anything else that makes truly great art great. But I just couldn’t find anything I liked.<p>Doing some research, I discovered StyleGAN and similar technologies. I found they were amazing at certain tasks, like turning photos to impressionist paintings, but were too limited to create the stuff I was most interested in. So I moved on.<p>Fast forward to today, the recent advances in generative imagery made it seem like the time might finally be right for this idea. So with a kick in the tuchus from fellow HN&#x27;er lowe0292, we decided to build it.<p>We use DALL-E 2 for generating images and SharpJS for the under-the-hood image manipulation. We use a service to upscale the images before printing, but will eventually run our own setup with Real-ESRGAN or similar.<p>Feedback very much appreciated :)",story,https://decorative.ai/generate,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
