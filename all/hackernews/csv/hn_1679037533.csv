35193846,Ask HN: Math book recommendations to relearn the fundamentals,2023-03-17T06:20:54Z,optbuild,5,false,false,,,,,,"I am a working programmer (mainly freelance). I am planning to go to grad school and I have heard that for a programmer knowing mathematics makes things n times easier. I have studied electrical engineering in an Indian college. Due to my math averseness (for whatever reason) I have only sketchy memories of what math was taught in college.<p>For the context, in India, mathematics is taught in a mechanical way. I remember integrals are used to find area, volume, etc. and derivatives to find rate of change. I remember doing meaningless and complicated integration problems on end and hating them. I was taught matrix algebra and remember how to multiply them and calculate determinants, but, no recollection of why and where to use them. I remember little multivariable calculus. I see people say that linear algebra should always come before multivariable calculus to get its real taste.<p>That is what I really want. I want the real taste of mathematics and how to apply it fruitfully in situations. I want to learn how to prove something and what it means to prove a thing in mathematics. I also want to learn why some theorem came about (the intuition) and then the rigor. I want both. I want to learn how to solve interesting problems.<p>I want to learn the base of the mathematical pyramid i.e. the foundations. I am listing a few topics that come to mind:<p>1. Calculus<p>2. Linear Algebra<p>3. Probability and Statistics<p>4. Approximation Math<p>5. Numerical methods<p>6. Proofs<p>I have ofcourse miss things. That is why I am asking help here. I will prefer resources that don&#x27;t water down things (I have already learned that way in school and college) and those that are suitable for self study.<p>If for some cases you think an online course may serve better than a course then don&#x27;t hesitate to list that, too.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
