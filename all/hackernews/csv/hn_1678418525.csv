35089698,Phone verification is ransomware to your privacy,2023-03-10T02:27:29Z,fukouda,4,false,false,,,,,,"Story for a context (skip to last paragraph for actual question)<p>So, imagine you&#x27;ve got yourself Discord account used semi-actively for over 5 years and one day you are locked out of it, because you decided to send a friend request to someone you have DM history spanning over years, since you no longer had any shared servers.           
First thing you are asked, when adding a friend is to confirm your email(?) - which, ironically, it asked you just a while ago to check inbox of, in order to confirm login from different IP (I guess these days your IP number is your SSN and never changes, understandable), so not entirely sure what Discord is trying to accomplish here (for reference email in question has been confirmed a looong time ago and not changed for multiple years by now). Fine, maybe somehow it got automatically marked as stale, for &quot;security reasons&quot;, even though it was fine just a second ago to get past login screen..
Okay, after doing that and like 20 captchas about basketball, since completing at least 5 in a row each time is considered minimum to prove one&#x27;s humanity (or you know, do captcha too fast, you are a bot, good luck on another ten) and basically training some AI botnet for free, you return to friend list tab, and what you see - &quot;Something&#x27;s Going on here&quot;, now if you could kindly provide us with your phone number and maybe, just maybe, if your phone number was part of our favourite country whitelist, we will let you back in, else - you know, that day you decided to press add to friends button - that was a huge mistake.           
Solution (pretty much citing discord support stance) - please, create new account(?), rinse and repeat, since we would rather choke on our own shit, than unlock an account if we couldn&#x27;t pinpoint your position down to the coach.<p>This and many other stories is what happens to me over and over in span of last years.
Their &quot;abuse&quot; filters feel so trigger happy that I&#x27;ve seen this happening, when joining a server from public link (mind you server without phone verification) or doing basically any random thing that itself is in no way considered an abuse.<p>I&#x27;m putting discord on the spot here, but truth is almost all &quot;popular&quot; services do this, like they know that they are invisible by now and will probably get whatever they feel like getting at that particular day (from most). 
At this point I feel like actual ransomware being less invasive, since criminals at least have sense of decency to not ask for a phone number.<p>Question, I wander why is it even legal for all these services to just lock you effectively out of all your data (I&#x27;m sure there is a nice way to deflect this statement as well, by saying that all my messages are property of service provider or something along these lines) at no time notice, making situation pretty much mental ransomware - pay us with your personal data or be locked of what we kept. I understand any company is allowed to refuse providing their services at any time, but at this point is there really nothing law-wise stopping them from requiring your bank number next, since you know - noone is being forced to do anything, you can just not provide that data and stay locked forever, right.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
