35370579,Show HN: CodePrompt – a UI for loading code repos into GPT prompts,2023-03-30T10:32:48Z,chunza2542,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN, I&#x27;m Chun Rapeepat.<p>Last week I started playing with GPT-4 and tried different ways to use it to optimize my dev workflow. It was fun, and I was just blown away by what GPT-4 can do.<p>The idea of CodePrompt first came to mind when I read &quot;Show HN: GPT Repo Loader – load entire code repos into GPT prompts&quot; [1]. It was precisely what I wanted to do! So I tried it.<p>The GPT Repo Loader works pretty well on a small codebase; However, due to its limitations in loading all files and content into the prompt, I still ran into token context limit issues and needed to copy&#x2F;edit the code myself.<p>That&#x27;s when I started working on CodePrompt. Instead of loading the entire repo, why not just load only relevant files or portions of code (or function headers?) that need for the requirement?<p>How I designed the user journey of CodePrompt.xyz:
1. Choose a GPT model.
2. Select a repo that you want to work with.
3. Pick the relevant files that you want to include in the prompt.
4. Add specific instructions and remove irrelevant codes as needed.
5. Copy the prompt to your chosen GPT model to generate the desired output. Chat &amp; Iterate.
6. If you want to do something else, just go to (3) again.<p>This allows me to easily generate prompts to do something like 
- Implement features that evolve edits on multiple files
- Create new components while reusing existing codebase
- Generate code with the same style as other files, etc.<p>I would love to hear all your feedback and ideas on how I can improve it. Or if you want to chat, feel free to ping me on my Twitter @chunrapeepat.<p>P.S. The project is 100% open-source and free to use.

35370873,Show HN: Building Browser Extensions Using FileSystem APIs (and ChatGPT),2023-03-30T11:10:52Z,thomas101,2,false,false,1,[35370883],,,,"Hi HN! Wavebox Flow (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flow.wavebox.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flow.wavebox.io</a>) is an open-source (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wavebox&#x2F;wavebox-flow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wavebox&#x2F;wavebox-flow</a>) browser extension builder that runs directly in your browser. We want to help make building your first extension, or prototyping that idea that&#x27;s been sat on your desk as simple as possible. There&#x27;s sometimes this bit of &quot;where I do I start&quot; syndrome, where you&#x27;re not sure what to start with, or even where to look. Given the advancements of the HTML5 FileSystem APIs, it&#x27;s now possible to store your extension files directly on disk and edit them with the amazing Monaco editor. If you&#x27;re prototyping and start to feel that your idea is growing legs, there&#x27;s nothing stopping you opening the extension in your favourite editor and continuing from there - the output is just standard a WebExtension.<p>We&#x27;ve been using Flow internally for a few months to create helper extensions, such as one that helps us to link support tickets to our internal admin system and another that helps us with the GitHub approval flow. Both in record time and with minimal effort. When we realised how much of useful tool it is, we felt that we could couldn&#x27;t keep it proprietary and the best thing to do, would be to open-source it and make sure compatibility is great with as many browsers as possible.<p>The extensions that you create are compatible with any Chromium browser and also Firefox. If you&#x27;re using the Wavebox browser, we&#x27;ve added some additional tooling so you can skip some of the manual extension installation and reloading steps, but Wavebox Flow is fully featured in any browser. And of course, what product wouldn&#x27;t be complete these days without an integrated ChatGPT to help with coding and catching errors.<p>This is just the start, we open-sourced the initial version but are looking to develop Flow further. We&#x27;d love to hear about any feedback that you have and how we can make Wavebox Flow better.

For the demo use the provided login demo&#x2F;demo or you can register your own account (no email required).<p>Listidge tries to make it super simple to create and share to-do lists, wishlists, collections and more with anyone. Once your list is ready for sharing you can publish to a URL that anyone can visit without logging in. I was frustrated with proprietary wishlists that lock you in and thought a simple &quot;list sharing concept&quot; could apply to lots of other things like to-dos, collections, mood boards etc.<p>It&#x27;s open source under the AGPL license, written in Python, Django and Bootstrap. It can be self-hosted and run from source or in a single container. Images are available on Docker Hub (links below) or build it from the provided Dockerfile in the repo. I am rusty on frontend dev so feedback would be much appreciated!<p>The demo is limited to just three types of list and editing is crude: add&#x2F;delete only.
