Seems like a bad actor could then steal personal data from all manner of large news sites and other social media services, or just do whatever they want to the content or layout on the same.<p>Fortunately certain sites do avoid this by not using the embed (the BBC uses images, the Guardian uses a standard blockquote), but many others don&#x27;t, and I suspect it&#x27;d be a mad rush to remove said script if anything like that happened.<p>Am I overthinking this, or is this a potential security nightmare that Musk&#x27;s management could make more likely?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
