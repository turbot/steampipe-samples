34983201,Upcoming price changes to Linode services,2023-03-01T15:10:21Z,rreyes1979,3,false,false,,,,,,"Hello,<p>As we expand our cloud product portfolio and work to improve the resiliency and reach of our network, we face the same challenges as many of our customers: a tough financial climate with growing costs for data center space, energy usage, and newer hardware. We have resisted making changes to our offerings for as long as possible, and we understand this may not be the news you wish to hear from us, but we are announcing price changes for certain compute services effective April 1, 2023.<p>On April 1st, you will see the following changes to our pricing model:<p>Shared and Dedicated CPU plan prices will increase by 20%<i>.
The price of additional IPv4 addresses beyond 1 will increase from $1 to $2 each</i>, per month across all of our existing core data center locations.
Transfer (egress) fees are being reduced from $0.01 to $0.005 per GB* up to 1PB per month across all of our existing core data center locations.
What’s not changing?<p>The price of Nanodes (1GB Shared CPU plans).
The price of NodeBalancers, Backups, Managed Databases, Linode Images, High Memory plans, GPU plans, and the High-Availability Control Planes on Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) are exempt from price changes. All other cluster nodes deployed with LKE will be billed according to the new Shared or Dedicated CPU pricing.
IPv6 addresses and pools will remain free.
*You will start accruing the new cost of these services on April 1st, and they will be reflected on the first invoice you receive after that date.<p>Despite these changes, we remain more aggressively priced than our peer providers, and with continued investment in our cloud computing services, customers can look forward to new and improved services on our roadmap:<p>Network expansion, with existing and new data centers running on the Akamai backbone.
New ISO, SOC 2, and HIPAA standards compliance.
Capacity improvements across the board.
New core and distributed sites as part of the Akamai Connected Cloud.
Performance updates to cloud primitives like Object Storage.
New services like VPC and Functions for serverless compute.
We believe this is the best way to build a bigger and better platform that enables your cloud computing success in the future, and we hope that you’ll stick with us through this period of growth and change.<p>--
