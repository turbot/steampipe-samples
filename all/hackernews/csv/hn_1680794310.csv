We allow users to build web apps and chatbots by chaining LLM APIs (we call processors) from providers like OpenAI, StabilityAI, Cohere etc, without writing any code. We also let users to bring in their own data and store it in a vector database to be used for context augmentation in their apps. Users can import data from a variety of sources including urls, sitemaps, PDFs and other file types<p>Published apps are accessible to app&#x27;s users via a public url. Chat apps can also be embedded as a chat bubble on external websites. There are also high level processors offered by Promptly which unlocks things like extracting text from files, youtube urls etc., enabling users to build some sophisticated applications.<p>Here are some example applications: <i>Resume generator</i> - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trypromptly.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;d478594d-2082-46c9-bee7-f057f4bc"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trypromptly.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;d478594d-2082-46c9-bee7-f057f4bc</a>... - Uses single ChatGPT processor to generate tailored resume based on user and job information<p><i>Story generator</i> - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trypromptly.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;9d6da897-67cf-4887-94ec-afd4b936"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trypromptly.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;9d6da897-67cf-4887-94ec-afd4b936</a>... - Takes in a theme, generates a short story and an illustration to go with it. This is built with three processors, ChatGPT to generate story -&gt; ChatGPT to generate DALL-E prompt -&gt; DALL-E image generation.<p><i>Promptly support</i> - Chatbot on Promptly website itself is built on the platform with website url as the datasource. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ajhai&#x2F;status&#x2F;1643521969072242689"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ajhai&#x2F;status&#x2F;1643521969072242689</a> shows how the chatbot was built.<p>We built Promptly as a prompt and LLM workflow management platform out of our experience using LLMs at MakerDojo and landed here.

We wanted to build a tool for JIT access that was <i>actually</i> designed for developers. We were wary of tools that tried to accommodate both devs and IT but ended up with usability compromises for both.<p>First, we figured no one wants another web app to log into so we let administrators define access workflows in Terraform and let developers request and gain access via Slack. That seemed to pay off: being code-based was a big plus for our early customers since it let them manage the logic in version control and test in CI&#x2F;CD.<p>Second, we knew that updating permissions&#x2F;roles&#x2F;access was a major source of toil and risk in the world of cloud infrastructure. Have you ever tried to avoid annoying, persistent access requests by setting policies that are a bit more permissive than you’d like? We felt that fully automated just-in-time access + approvals could really help here. But we also knew that a simple approval tool could end up leading to request fatigue - kind of defeating the purpose. So we built an SDK to let you define checks in code (e.g. pagerduty.on_call, okta.is_user_in_group,  github.get_repo_collaborators) in order to dynamically route requests or fast-track access when appropriate. This seems to be paying off: users are creating Slack-based approvals in front of different types of risky actions like production access, sensitive queries and triggering Lambdas.<p>We’d love your feedback on our approach so far. Does this make sense to you? Is this a tool you&#x27;d use? What would you want to see out of it?<p>To learn more, check out the video that Nick (nmeans (Sym VPEng)) made [1].
