I have and, as a result, decided to make my own, GPU-accelerated (webgl2) graph plotter that renders equations, shaded plots, etc. with butter-smooth framerates.<p>Equations we are used to think as unplottable (with usable real-time performance), like for example `e ^ (sin(x) * x ^ 2 * cos(y)) = cos(e ^ (x * y))`, will render just as smoothly [0] as something simple, like `y = x ^ 2`.<p>Goals:
* Rendering (almost) any equation without performance problems
* Enabling acquiring new insights from being able to closely interact with complicated equations
* Having an intuitive, easy-to-use and not-buggy interface<p>Non-goals:
* Being a general-purpose CAS software<p>KGraph is under active development, and features such as parametric equations are coming in the near future!<p>Thank you for your feedback!<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaapporaivio.fi&#x2F;graph&#x2F;?d=camera%3A%28current%3A%28x%3A3.6663316582914574%2Cy%3A1.9135678391959798%2Czoom%3A-4%29%29%2Cinputs%3A%21%28%28color%3A%23ff7f00%2CglslSource%3A%27%27%2Cname%3A%27%27%2CrawInput%3A%27e+%5E+%28sin%28x%29+*+x+%5E+2+*+cos%28y%29%29+%3D+cos%28e+%5E+%28x+*+y%29%29%27%2Ctype%3Afunction%29%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaapporaivio.fi&#x2F;graph&#x2F;?d=camera%3A%28current%3A%28x%...</a>",story,https://kaapporaivio.fi/graph/about,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
