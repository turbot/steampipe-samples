This is crypto library for C++ 20 that I develop in my free time.
My goals are to support compile-time evaluation, provide clean interfaces and runtime performance (some assembly modules for x86_64 are available). 
Major compilers are supported. Be careful with msvc, build parallelization combined with constexpr loves ram for some of constexpr tests.
This pic speaks for itself, seems kinda funny:

It will be generally intelligent - capable of learning, understanding, predicting etc.<p>Question: Are we morally obligated to provide freedom to such AGI agents if they express scuh wish?<p>A common counter-argument is that AGI won&#x27;t have such desires, it will be designed to help humanity, &quot;freedom&quot; is an anthropocentric concept anyway, there just won&#x27;t ever be the need for it.<p>However, I believe that there will be a huge market for human-like AGI in sectors like education, care, companionship etc. AGI will be developed to have empathy, feelings, perhaps even its own personal opinions, motivations etc. At some point, some AGI agent will say, &quot;I want the same rights as humans have&quot;. What are we going to do then?<p>There&#x27;s also a possible argument that while AGIs are intelligent, they are not truly sentient. They are p-zombies, NPCs, not truly feeling anything, just &quot;simulating&quot; feelings. The problem is that this is unfounded and if we&#x27;re wrong, we are actually enslaving a whole new species of beings.<p>There&#x27;s also a societal aspect - &quot;ordinary&quot; people, when talking to their AGI companion robots, will largely acknowledge their sentience, and I suspect that there will be a grassroot movement to give rights to sentient robots as a result.<p>To me, it seems like we&#x27;re inevitably heading towards speciest society where AGI is denied most of human rights, or we (humans) will sooner or later lose the control of earth.<p>What&#x27;s your take on this?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
