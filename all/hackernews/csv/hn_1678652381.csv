When hiring talents or judging peers ?<p>Big companies who think they&#x27;re more important than they truly are often look for workers with experience, or will do them pass leetcode style coding games.<p>But personally, when I hear than someone has done exactly the same job for 5+ years, I can&#x27;t help but to think &#x27;boring&#x27; (with rolling eyes internally). I believe the corporate world feels about the same, as it wants ppl who have a success story, and a stonk progression from not a developer to CTO of his multi billion tech startup in 5 years.<p>How do you combine the conflicting requirements from a lot of years on exactly the same job, and of having had a career and flexibility ?<p>Deep down, I feel like all this experience thing is a trap, and a distraction.<p>When you are a junior, companies turn you down because they want experienced workers.<p>But when you are a senior, in your 50s, and have 20+ years of experience, companies consider you like a dinosaur who can&#x27;t evolve, and prefer a new hire who is humble and curious.<p>So experience isn&#x27;t the issue !<p>How would you balance these requirements ?<p>And how do you prepare for the end of your career ?<p>What would you actually focus on, if not experience ?<p>And how would you interview peers ?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
