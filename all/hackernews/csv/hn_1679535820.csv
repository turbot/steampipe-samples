35269287,Ask HN: Is software going to replace managers?,2023-03-23T01:05:17Z,lifeisstillgood,3,false,false,2,[35269309],,,,"Ok - so there is a bbc podcast on this I am halfway through - it&#x27;s pretty darn good but it has a sort of thesis that you can replace the manager part with some co-ordination software.<p>Which kind of begs the question what is a manager?<p>Anyway - my first thought is coders are new managers (the real knowledge workers are CPUs and GPUs, and if the job of a manager is to build systems to co-ordinate and improve their workers, then that is a good description of a coder)<p>and second thought is that an awful
lot of what is table stakes for a software project today is replacing co-ordination with software<p>A simple CO&#x2F;CD pipeline plus regression testing allows disparate teams to work on the same &quot;system&quot; without serious conflicts, and throw in decent feature flaggging and much of the &quot;programme manager role is gone&quot;<p>it&#x27;s late, but I am interested in peoples thoughts",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35269246,"Show HN: Inject VSCode code, errors, and definitions into your ChatGPT prompt",2023-03-23T00:58:22Z,5n,1,false,false,,,,,,"I made this project for myself over the past two days. It&#x27;s a web app that lets you build a ChatGPT prompt where you can add code, errors, and symbol definitions from VSCode in one click.<p>1. Run the web app from docker
2. Download the VSCode extension and run the connect command
3. Construct prompt
4. Paste into ChatGPT&#x2F;some other tool<p>Why it&#x27;s useful:
- LLM neutral: paste prompts into ChatGPT, Claude, Bing Chat, Bard, etc.
- No need to fiddle with copy&#x2F;pasting code snippets or error messages
- Free Software under AGPLv3
- Fully local, no telemetry or tracking.<p>The architecture is in three parts:
1. VSCode extension that sends symbols, diagnostics, and open files to the server over both REST and Websockets.
2. Haskell Server that talks with the VSCode extension and serves the static frontend.
3. Static frontend in SvelteKit.<p>For production, the backend and frontend are packaged together with nix (see `flake.nix`) and turned into a Docker image, though they can also be run separately. The extension is packaged the normal way with `vsce`.<p>Please let me know what you think!",story,https://github.com/TextQLLabs/mkprompt,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
