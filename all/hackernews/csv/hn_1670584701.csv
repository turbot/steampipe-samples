- Has two inputs (PC and an RCA) that are mixed internally 
- Has a very gratifying, smooth volume control knob&#x2F;puck that sits on my desk and has an on&#x2F;off switch plus a headphone jack for cut-over<p>Things that could be improved:<p>- Audio quality (it&#x27;s great for calls, OK for listening to music)
- You can&#x27;t really change any of the wiring (it&#x27;s all pre-wired)
- No hardware equalizer (I make do with software, it&#x27;s just a very minor niggle)<p>Things I had to do to fit my setup, just so you have an idea of how I use it:<p>- I added a passive mixer to one of the inputs so I could have an Alexa Echo Listen, another PC, a synth and a Pi that is my combo Airplay&#x2F;PlexAmp speaker all go through the same speakers
- Added a noise&#x2F;hum filter after that, since some inputs are noisy<p>I don&#x27;t need it to have USB audio or be amazingly loud (small office, and the Z333 is plenty loud enough), but would love better audio quality even though I love the convenience of the thing.<p>(I&#x27;ve been thinking of building my own speakers, but finding a good amp -- or an equivalent sub-woofer that also had a control puck but let me upgrade the speakers -- hasn&#x27;t been easy).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Have you ever felt down? Useless? Unable to anything? Unable to help? To provide support to those you’ve loved, cared about, to people need, to others you once sweared you’d do anything for them once you’d be happy?<p>How old are you now? 20? 30? 40? 50? 60? Guys, gang, don’t wait. Get out of this frustration. For the people you cared about, think about yourself. Think how to take an action. If you’re struggling with a bigger change, start from baby steps. Let yourself take an action. You’ve dreamed about career? Family? Business? Start acting. Don’t wait for everything to calm down, because it won’t. Things will change, that’s right. But the people around do need you. For every second you waste, someone wastes two seconds on the other side of the world because they don’t have you!<p>Think about starting something. Doing something good, about wellbeing. Think how can you change something small if you’re struggling with having thoughts on how to change the world. Remember the child in yourself who once wanted to meet the things around, to visit places, to make the first steps, to find the answers.<p>Make a change, don’t be afraid. Make the haters fear. Not yourself and your beloved ones.<p>Start learning. Find a hobby, meet friends. Meet new people. Give a room for something special in your life to happen.<p>Let world’s leader be you. Don’t expect from someone to make the change. Be you the change you want to happen.<p>If you’re expecting an if statement at the end of this article, there won’t be an if statement.<p>Make the change now! Change the world today. Start with something small, for someone it would be considered as something much bigger and much greater than you think. Start acting today.<p>If you cannot do, teach, if you cannot teach learn. If you cannot learn, lay down and make yourself look like you’re pretending to be smart.<p>Did you know that some people cannot even imagine? Make that inspire you. Try thinking of something, something great. Something that could things around being better.<p>Have you dreamt about programming? Start researching. You like med? Start reading med articles then. You’re into music? Great! Start learning music sheets. You want a car? An apartment? Start talking to people who have such things and looking for them actively.<p>Something happened with someone? Don’t let that bring you down! Respect that person and start talking to people. Let yourself hear others opinion you haven’t heard before. Some could hate them, but let that pain vanish and go away.<p>Let yourself heal.<p>The world needs you my dear.<p>’’
I’m available 24&#x2F;7 for those among you who need me. If someone needs help, please consider talking to people. Not everything always goes as you expected, but it’s important to make the first steps towards the safe shore. Don’t let yourself drown in thoughts, and seek for people who’re ready to help. Even if you cannot afford a paid consultation, find someone, look for other people and talk to them.
