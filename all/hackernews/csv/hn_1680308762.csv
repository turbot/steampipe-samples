I know this because I&#x27;ve tried. I didn&#x27;t realize this was a rule and tried sharing my startup (RentZed) with InternetIsBeautiful Subreddit. It is a website where users can post and view rent prices, like a Glassdoor for Rents. The post got a lot of traction with 200k views and 1.5k upvotes within 8 hours and lots of comments asking questions about it and some saying how helpful this could be. I then got banned for having an account dedicated to my startup because I made 3 other posts about it in other subreddits.<p>I&#x27;ve tried using other social media platforms to share the site but haven&#x27;t had much success. It seems pretty difficult to navigate other social media algorithms starting from 0 compared to Reddit.<p>As a user of Reddit, I really don&#x27;t care if a startup makes a post or comment on Reddit. In fact, I&#x27;d like to see startups do this so it&#x27;s easier for me to learn about their services in case I ever want to utilize them.<p>I&#x27;m curious if anyone else even knows about this rule and what they think of it.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
