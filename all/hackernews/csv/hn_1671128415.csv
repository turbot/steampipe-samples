I’ve mentioned it to a direct manager, and the reasoning is that 15min&#x2F;day over the course of a year is a large cost, and tracking ops time vs product time is something they find valuable… and that makes sense to me, but I can’t seem to shake whatever red flags this is flying in my head.<p>Most places I’ve worked at have tracked points, which still relate to time in a way, but are large enough to account for bad estimates, by design.
