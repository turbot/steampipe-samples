I wanted to ask your advice.<p>I recently completed my first year of a two-year software development diploma. I learned Python in my first term, Java in my second. I&#x27;ll be learning C in January, my third term.<p>To improve my skills over the winter break, I&#x27;m building a Wordle clone in Java. In addition, I&#x27;d like to read a book on software development. Problem is, there are so many books, so many topics, that I&#x27;m honestly a bit overwhelmed.<p>For example, do I do a deep dive on Java? Or do I focus on a more language-agnostic topic, such as refactoring or design patterns?<p>I have a few great books, and I&#x27;d love your input on which I should tackle first:<p>-- Core Java (Horstmann)
-- The Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt &amp; Thomas)
-- Refactoring (Fowler)
-- Head First Design Patterns (Freeman et al.)
-- Design Patterns (Gamma et al.)
-- Clean Code (Martin)<p>I&#x27;m more than happy to hear other recommendations, too. (I have a running list, and I plan to read them all and get better, little by little.)<p>Thanks for considering my question. I appreciate any and all feedback!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
