We previously founded [Wit.ai](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wit.ai&#x2F;) (W14), which we sold to Facebook in 2015. Since 2019, we&#x27;ve been working on Nabla (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nabla.com), an intelligent assistant for health practitioners.<p>When GPT-3 was released in 2020, we investigated it&#x27;s usage in a medical context[0], to mixed results.<p>Since then we’ve kept exploring opportunities at the intersection of healthcare and AI, and noticed that doctors spend am awful lot of time on medical documentation (writing clinical notes, updating their EHR, etc.).<p>Today, we&#x27;re releasing Nabla Copilot, a Chrome extension generating clinical notes from video consultations, to address this problem.<p>You can try it out, without installation nor sign up, on our demo page: [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nabla.com&#x2F;copilot-demo&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nabla.com&#x2F;copilot-demo&#x2F;)<p>Here’s how it works under the hood:<p>- When a doctor starts a video consultation, our Chrome extension auto-starts itself and listens to the active tab as well as the doctor’s microphone.
- We then transcribe the consultation using a fine-tuned version of Whisper. We&#x27;ve trained Whisper with tens of thousands of hours of medical consultation and medical terms recordings, and we have now reached an error rate which is 3× lower than Google&#x27;s Speech-To-Text.
- Once we have the transcript, we feed it to a heavily trained GPT-3, which generates a clinical note.
- We finally return the clinical note to the doctor through our Chrome extension, the doctor can copy it to their EHR, and send a version to the patient.<p>This allows doctors to be fully focused on their consultation, and saves them a lot time.<p>Next, we want to make this work for in-person consultation.<p>We also want to extract structured data (in the FHIR standard) from the clinical note, and feed it to the doctor’s EHR so that it is automatically added to the patient&#x27;s record.<p>Happy to further discuss technical details in comments!<p>---<p>[0]: [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nabla.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gpt-3&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nabla.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gpt-3&#x2F;)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Then my daughter started preschool, with a 9:00 drop-off, and it became a stressor.  Little kids are tough to move on schedule, there can be surprise messes, surprise bathroom trips, general crankiness, etc.  Some days I was pulling up Teams for the first time that day at like 9:29 and struggling to even remember what I&#x27;d done yesterday.  And more importantly, I just felt <i>stressed</i> all morning, constantly looking at the clock as I was getting the kid dressed, prepping breakfast, packing the school bag, etc.<p>On my newly-formed team, it just happens that the lead decided on a 10:15 daily stand-up time.  Since that happened, my mornings have been stress-free!  I have time to log in and get caught up and just feel settled before stand-up, and I&#x27;m not wincing every time I see the clock in the morning.<p>This was just a happy accident for me, but it made me realize, none of the half dozen or so teams I&#x27;ve worked on since daily stand-up became de rigueur have asked for team member input on what time stand-up should be held, it&#x27;s just been mandated, I guess at the convenience of the project lead.<p>Anyone else encounter any best practices for scheduling daily stand-up?

35151198,Show HN: Eagle Eye – Grow your DevTool by engaging with content,2023-03-14T13:32:27Z,jonathan_re,6,false,false,2,"[35151255,35151444]",,,,"Growing your DevTool can be frustrating. Developers don&#x27;t respond well to traditional marketing. They don&#x27;t like to be sold to, are active on specific social platforms, and trust their peers more than anything else. Therefore, ads, whitepapers, or cold emails have notoriously low conversion rates.<p>What does work well is building relationships with developers based on common interests. One of the most effective ways to do this is to spot content related to your DevTool and insert yourself in the conversation.<p>To help with just that, we launched Eagle Eye. (live on Product Hunt today!)<p>Eagle Eye lets you discover and engage with the most relevant content in your developer niche. It continuously monitors 10+ developer-focused platforms and generates a personalized feed for you to jump into discussions and add value.
