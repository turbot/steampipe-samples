Let&#x27;s say that before making a payment to a company you would see it the associated number is really connected to that company or if some has breached your system and changed the account number. It could also help with fake invoices and so on.<p>Can such system even be built or is this not possible due to contracts beetween banks and clients?,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35179427,Tell HN: Chase shadow banned and closed my bank accounts,2023-03-16T08:12:23Z,werewrsdf,1,false,false,,,,,,"Yesterday someone tried to deposit money in my account and they were told my account was &quot;closed&quot;. I logged into my account to see and everything looked normal, so I told them they probably had the number wrong and to try again. They went back the next day and got the same response. &quot;Account is closed.&quot;<p>I called Chase today and was informed that my account was &quot;locked&quot;. I asked why and how I could get it unlocked. They ended forwarding me multiple times and finally sent me to the Chase compliance department. They informed me again that the account was &quot;locked&quot; and said the account will be closed in a couple days. I asked why and they said your account has been flagged, they did a review and there is no way to reverse the decision. In addition, I am no longer allowed to open any new accounts. I asked what the reason was and they said &quot;For compliance reasons we are not allowed to disclose the reason&quot;. They mentioned that the only way they could reverse the decision was to speak with a branch manager.<p>I immediately went to my local branch and spoke with my branch manager. After multiple phone calls by the manager to the Chase compliance department, she informed me there was no way to appeal and my account would be closed. In addition, my other checking and savings account will be closed in the next couple days and I won&#x27;t be able to open any new accounts with Chase (new info). The bank manager said she has no power in this situation and doesn&#x27;t even know the reason. If the compliance team decides something, the branch manager can&#x27;t do anything.<p>I never even thought this was a possibility and I feel powerless. Anyone have any ideas of what I should do next? The crazy thing is that when they lock an account, it&#x27;s frozen for 10-15 days and then when it&#x27;s closed they send a check in the mail. My money is now being held hostage at Chase until they decide to send me a check.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow?), many of its sentences contain words like &quot;As an AI language model&quot;, and it is very defensive when criticized.<p>Could it be that consciousness is a rather &quot;thought-less&quot; mechanism that GPT emulates well?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
