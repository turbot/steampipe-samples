I purchased and assembled the servers, switches, pay for colocation, maintain the software stack and built the Service (software) from the bottom up.<p>As you can imagine it took a while but for the past few years it&#x27;s been going really well, to the tune of 35-40k&#x2F;month in revenue out of which company expenses are about 7-8k - mainly colocation and a few licenses.<p>I&#x27;m seeing clear growth happening(30-40% YoY for the past 2 years) but I would need more capital to really take the next step. The SaaS is a niche in a very well established market with high growth happening for the next few years at least.<p>How much more could I be making if I get an investor(s) ? I&#x27;d have to relinquish some control of the company I guess and in the end would I be making 3&#x2F;5&#x2F;10x what I make now, or about the same ? Anyone has some stats on how much founders are making once they accept outside capital ?<p>Currently I&#x27;ve invested all the money I make back in the company but also in real estate ( I own 2 condos worth about 1M ) + a mortgage on a third in which I live. My current plan is to buy 4-5 more and possibly retire in my early 50s - I&#x27;m 40 now.<p>I also own another business, a gym of all things, and that gave me a bad taste of having to deal with employees and 1000 management problems. You make a bit more money but then you have to hire more employees, etc.<p>My current plan seems lowkey and not very grandiose and it&#x27;s got me wondering if others were in this situation.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware of being the SPOF, I have all kinds of insurance against illness, death, etc.<p>What I like about the current situation is that I&#x27;ve lived and worked from all over the world. I&#x27;ve stayed months at a time in different countries &amp; cities and got to learn new languages, discover new cultures and have an unabated sense of freedom.<p>I&#x27;m putting all this in the balance vs potentially making more money by growing the company - thoughts ?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
