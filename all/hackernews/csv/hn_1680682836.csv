I would like to ask your advice.
I have been accepted for a master in electrical engineering at TU DELF , and I have also applied for the same master at EPFL.

35450889,"Show HN: I open-sourced CoverLetterGPT.xyz – 900 users, feat. on indiehackers",2023-04-05T08:07:37Z,hot_town,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN peeps!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on coverlettergpt.xyz for the past few weeks. It was recently featured in the IndieHackers newsletter[0] and is just shy of 900 users.<p>You can use it to generate cover letters by copy &amp; pasting the job description, uploading your CV&#x2F;résumé, and changing a few settings. The app will then generate cover letters for you, which you can further edit with GPT. You can also manage your jobs, create multiple cover letters per job, and other fun stuff.<p>I&#x27;m honestly quite surprised at the response to it, as it&#x27;s &quot;yet another GPT wrapper,&quot; but I&#x27;ve built in some features that seem to be resonating with job-seekers, e.g.:<p>- upload and parsing of pdf résumé&#x2F;CV<p>- management of multiple jobs and cover letters per job<p>- &quot;creativity&quot; controls for GPT&#x27;s output<p>- further GPT revisions via selecting text and &quot;editing-in-place&quot;<p>The fact that I open-sourced[1] it seems to have also driven a lot of traffic to the site. I always intended to do so, as I saw it more as a fun learning project rather than a profitable side-project, but it has pulled in just over $100 of revenue since launching last month.<p>I built the entire app using Wasp[2] as the full-stack framework (think Ruby-on-Rails for the PERN stack), with the OpenAI API of course, payments with Stripe, emails with SendGrid, and Chakra-UI[3] as the design system. I was able to build the MVP within 3 days, mostly thanks to the speed of development that Wasp and Chakra enabled.<p>It&#x27;s been fun learning and building a fullstack &quot;side-project&quot; that generates revenue. There are a lot of things I tackled for the first time here, so it is a bit rough around certain edges, but I hope some of you will find it interesting and learn something from it as well.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;whats-new-don-t-build-things-no-one-wants-833ee752ba"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;whats-new-don-t-build-thin...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vincanger&#x2F;coverlettergpt"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vincanger&#x2F;coverlettergpt</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chakra-ui.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chakra-ui.com</a>",story,https://coverlettergpt.xyz,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
