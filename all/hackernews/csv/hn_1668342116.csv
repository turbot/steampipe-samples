Most of them are overly complicated and painful to use. Some others, like Trello, are too limited for my needs.<p>Most importantly, most of these tools tend to be focused on team collaboration and completely ignore personal productivity.<p>They are useful for organizing my work, but not great at helping me stay focused to get things done.<p>That&#x27;s why I decided to build Upbase.<p>I try to make it clean and simple, without all the bells and whistles. Apart from team collaboration, I added many personal productivity features, including Weekly&#x2F;Daily planner, Time blocking, Pomodoro Timer, Daily Journal, etc. so I don&#x27;t need another to-do list app.<p>Now I can use Upbase to collaborate with my team AND manage your personal stuff at the same time, without all the bloat.<p>If these resonate with you, then give Upbase a try. It has a Free Forever plan though.<p>Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!",story,https://upbase.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It is a fast and scalable general purpose remote code execution engine. The goal of this project was to get to know golang a bit better and. Currently, kira is in its early stage, and currently it does not support multiple files. However, I am constantly trying to work on this project and improve it. Feel free, to give me feedback in any way! Thank you :)<p>The main ideas for this project:<p>* Fast and secure remote code execution engine that is scalable,<p>* Logging of the code executions,<p>* Test runner that executes custom unit tests (for building something like leetcode),<p>* Future: custom docker environments to have long-term projects",story,https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/kira,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
