It lost the ringtone I&#x27;ve set, so I had to set it again. Before selecting the ringtone, it shown a full screen ad, then another ad after selecting it. This is not a free app from Google App store, it&#x27;s Xiaomi&#x27;s own system.<p>I don&#x27;t want to install a custom Android image. Is iPhone the only alternative to getting rid of ads trends?

I&#x27;ve been looking for a super-simple drawboard app to share hand drawings (code diagrams) during online meetings.
Features I am looking for:<p>- Draw on a tablet (using s pen on samsung for example), could be an app or a webapp
- Share the URL with coworkers during meetings (no need to screen-cast it)<p>I&#x27;ve been using scrcpy and OBS but it is not shared, and the setup is not lean.
I am aware of many whiteboard apps (Ziteboard..), what do you use?
Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
