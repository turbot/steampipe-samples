I&#x27;ve been following the project aside from what&#x27;s just posted here on HN.<p>Standard disclaimer: nobody is being paid to work for my interests, yada yada, be that as it may, from the outside looking in, I have concerns and am noticing a pattern that to me indicate that tangible dev interest is waning.<p>Looking at git commits, progress-reports, blog&#x2F;social posts, HN posts, Asahi Linux&#x27;s momentum and dev-interest it had a few months ago is slowing down when judged by those points.<p>- Are there other initiatives out there addressing linux on the m1&#x2F;m2 aside from Asahi?<p>- Asahi was very productive independently over the past year, but not many others are contributing at that level or frequency it once had. Are any larger distros considering officially targeting Apple Silicon?<p>- Are there plans for Asahi as a project to accrue more formalized funding or structure to generate more interest in the development duties toward achieving feature completion?<p>I like the hardware, I like linux, and I like where Asahi is going. After seeing many passionate projects driven by only a few developers flame out or slowly miss their mark after the fanfare died down, I wanted to get the discussion going with regards to surfacing any alternatives or other movers that are addressing this, or highlighting any possible needs that Asahi may have that would enhance its longevity and trajectory.<p>I hope this post is interpreted not as criticism but as care and concern and a first effort toward getting help for the project if this is indeed the case. Rather than debate over the facts, and whether or not this is just the clearing of low hanging fruit revealing longer and more difficult goals for the project, perhaps we could use this thread to address alternatives and possibilities with regard to helping Asahi move toward completion.<p>Thanks",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
