It was taking us 1-2 minutes for the every single change. So we developed a solution! We created a tool that lets us iterate changes in less than 1 second, without waiting for Unity to compile or reload the game.<p>We&#x27;ve been using this tool in our studio for a few years now and it&#x27;s been a game changer for us; saving massive amounts of frustration, and also helping us hit deadlines. We recently decided to make it public and share it with the wider community, while also helping us fund our future projects.<p>It&#x27;s free for Unity Personal users, and Unity Plus&#x2F;Pro&#x2F;Enterprise users can get a 30-day free trial followed by free 2 hours a day of usage until purchase (after which case it’s unlimited usage, no restrictions).<p>We hope this tool can help other developers too! Let us know what you think!",story,https://hotreload.net,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
