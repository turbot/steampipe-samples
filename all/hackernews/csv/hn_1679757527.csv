35303083,Ask HN: What is the point of smartphone wireless chargers?,2023-03-25T14:41:02Z,palata,2,false,false,4,"[35303126,35303135]",,,,"I get that manufacturers are happy to sell more crap, and consumers are happy to buy new shiny crap. And wireless chargers are more expensive than wires, so that&#x27;s an incentive for the manufacturer.<p>But technically, is it really worth making wireless chargers? It seems to me that they are strictly more complex, require more material, charge slower and are less energy efficient. Moreover, they still require a wire: instead of plugging it into the phone, you align its magnetic end to the magnet on the phone.<p>So is there an actual technical argument in favour of wireless chargers? Like is it that hard to make a waterproof usb socket that it justifies wasting material and energy with a radically different approach?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
