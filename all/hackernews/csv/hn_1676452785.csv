First time posting here (and first time finishing a side-project - I&#x27;m super proud).<p>DaysToDo is a site I worked on solo over Christmas during the first wave of ChatGPT hype. I was trying to think of good use-cases for an imperfect, lying datasource. It was a toss-up between this and a CPR advice tool, but I ended up on this.<p>It&#x27;s a travel planner! I was blown away by how good GPT3 was at providing travel info even for quieter destinations.<p>I know there&#x27;s a lot of GPT fatigue and I hope I didn&#x27;t wait too long to post this - have fun with it!<p>I&#x27;ll also post a blog with thoughts on building a product based on GPT3 (it&#x27;s on the site in draft if you want a peek) as soon as I can polish it off. Too wordy at the moment - need time to make it short.<p>Thanks everyone!<p>p.s. planning for the worst - if it goes down, I&#x27;ll up my OpenAI budget limit as soon as I can (shouldn&#x27;t affect paid itineraries)",story,https://www.daystodo.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
