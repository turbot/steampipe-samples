I also have got a second hat of seeing how Wagtail (a project I actively contribute code to) - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wagtail.org&#x2F; - can better encourage support.<p>Where I work, I do not have lots of say over big decisions, and essentially no say over financial decisions. However, would like to see how I could best advocate long term for supporting key open-source projects we rely on.<p>There is the &#x27;support&#x27; route but I am trying to side-step that and look to get money given to entities for their ongoing maintenance and to acknowledge the value it provides our company. In my thinking, paid support is a great way for organisations to contribute but not really what I am hoping to solve here.<p>## Any ideas or any war stories of dead ends or success stories of what has worked?<p>My current ideas are;<p>a. A project specific &#x27;kitty&#x27; of a budget that can be given each year to projects that help the current project I work on. pre-approved amount maybe linked to the revenue the product generates and then goes through some sign off.<p>b. A company wide &#x27;grants&#x27; like initiative where we get nominations from different teams for projects and these get dispersed annually.<p>c. Leveraging some sort of &#x27;in kind&#x27; donations but as a more formal process. Not contributions or time but rather linked to the services we provide.<p>## Tough reality<p>I am unlikely to get this going, it&#x27;s a tough sell when organisations get this stuff for &#x27;free&#x27;.<p>My biggest selling point is maybe retroactive value recognition (similar to how we give bonuses - sometimes - to staff) or proactive risk mitigation.<p>Secondary selling points are marketing (we get to promote ourselves to the developers out there and also as a more altruistic brand) and better internal developer community interactions (the nomination process).<p>Risks that the organisation may push back on are that public knowledge of the tools&#x2F;libraries we use may expose us, risks of the finance being put into the wrong hands, all the logistics of invoicing.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
