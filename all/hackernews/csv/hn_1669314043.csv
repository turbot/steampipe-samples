33734299,Ask HN: Why aren't there DSLs for Operating Systems?

Indeed, even &quot;general purpose&quot; programming languages are, in a sense, DSLs for ... math (Fortran), gofai (Lisp), etc. And of course there are zillions of more specific DSLs. The purpose of a DSL is to reduce the complexity of writing code for the target domain, which usually involves specialized vocabulary, functionality, and syntax. But the most complex programs that exist (well, at least among them) are operating systems. Yet we still build them in general purposes languages, like C. Of course, we almost immediately build a layer of functionality on the hardware and system services, but even when you get to the top, like programming bash commands, it&#x27;s largely done in C (for Unix-likes). I&#x27;m wondering whether&#x2F;why there isn&#x27;t a DSL for operating systems. (Or maybe there is, but it&#x27;s hard to find if so; I&#x27;ve never seen one, and it&#x27;s a difficult set of phrases to search the web for, so I might be just missing the obvious, for which I apologize in advance, and appreciate the pointers.)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

However I have very little experience in founding a company or talking to investors. I am based in Germany. And since the startup scene here still lacks a lot of funding I wonder what my next steps should be.<p>The university hubs are not an option, since they require you to hand over up to 45% of the company for only 100.000€-500.000€ funding. Given the regulations in the medtech market this money would not give that much runway. And looking in the future with multiple investment rounds I would end up with very little stake in the company.<p>I talked to my family and could collect 35.000€ in total myself.<p>I think the issue here is that this company would most likely not be a unicorn, or a fast growing startup that most investors look for. However, the profit margins are very large and the solution is very easy to scale. Thus the worldwide market is open at relatively little cost, compared to other solutions.<p>I already did market analysis, tested the solution with multiple clinicians, and my solution would cut the costs of clinical procedures (depending on the type of procedure performed) by up to 20%. I also have very positive feedback by the four clinicians that tried out the solution so far.<p>Four doesn&#x27;t sound like much but it is very hard to get in touch with a clinical expert as a single student without funding.<p>I could really use some advice on my situation here.
