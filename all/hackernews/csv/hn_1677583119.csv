34968058,Show HN: Performance GitHub Actions runners powered by Gaming CPUs,2023-02-28T11:12:47Z,thinkafterbef,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN,
BuildJet makes GitHub Actions faster, by running the workflows on our Gaming CPU cloud. You still get to keep everything GitHub Actions, we simply replace the underlying GitHub Actions runner with our Gaming CPUs. All you do is change 1 line, and get 2x faster and cheaper builds.<p>GitHub Action is very slow<p>- Developers are wasting their time – Waiting for GitHub Actions to give you a green checkbox on PR, is very wasteful and extremely tedious.<p>- GitHub Actions runner hardware is old and slow – GitHub Actions use old and slow machines from Azure. Some of your workflows run on servers from 2015.<p>- GitHub Actions use the wrong type of hardware – CI workflows are usually computing intense, and specifically require high single-core performance. GitHub Actions uses server CPUs, which generally have low single-core performance.<p>What BuildJet for GitHub Actions does:<p>GitHub Actions rely on server CPUs from Azure. Server CPUs mostly have low single-core performance. This is where BuildJet differentiates itself, with its fundamentally different approach to computing, using dedicated high-performance gaming CPUs that all have a very high-single core performance.<p>This provides an inherent speed advantage for BuildJet, even without software optimizations. High single-core performance is the key to a fast CI process, and BuildJet&#x27;s gaming CPU cloud is optimized to deliver just that.<p>Last year, we ran a benchmark where a MacBook Pro 2015 hardware beating a GitHub Actions runner in 2022. It’s yet another instance where you can see the limitation of using server CPUs in tasks that need high single-core performance.<p>Website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildjet.com&#x2F;for-github-actions"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildjet.com&#x2F;for-github-actions</a>",story,https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
