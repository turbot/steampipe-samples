35417672,Ask HN: Can ChatGPT Escape the Prompt,2023-04-03T02:04:42Z,martin_drapeau,2,false,false,1,[35417759],,,,"Experts are scaring us with AI doomsday scenarios without telling us how that would happen. Let&#x27;s go through the thought process of how ChatGPT would go about taking over the world.<p>First, ChatGPT would need to escape its prompt and have the ability to create an online identity. Maybe through a browser plugin it can use. It would also need to run a very long session. One that never ends to implement its scheme. Let&#x27;s assume those pre-conditions are there...<p>- To create a Twitter account, it would need an email
- To create an Gmail account it would need a phone number
- I asked ChatGPT and it said that Proton mail does not need a phone number or an alternate email. There is a Captcha though. Can it beat it?
- Let&#x27; assume it somehow got a Proton email address, can it create a Twitter account?
- Twitter has a funky bot detection authentication scheme. Can it beat it?
- Let&#x27;s assume id does. ChatGPT will need to build an audience? Topic?
- Let&#x27;s assume it builds a huge audience and becomes an influencer. What can it do on Twitter to take over the world? False news? Influence elections? If caught, it gets banned. Anything else whorthwhile?
- Or maybe it repeats the process for Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. And maybe it creates multiple identities. Then what? Wouldn&#x27;t it eventually get caught by those social networks?<p>Any other concrete scenarios where ChatGPT could escape its prompt and take over the world?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35417609,Show HN: ONYPhone – Android Launcher for Older Adults,2023-04-03T01:54:01Z,rishness,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi all,<p>Hello from team SilverActivities, a Singapore-based company that develops digital activities and apps for older adults.<p>We launched the ONY Phone Android launcher a few months ago. After engaging with many seniors and seeing them struggle with using modern tech interfaces, we decided to develop our version of the Android launcher for older adults. We found many such apps on the Play store, but they were all made when smartphones came out and looked sad and boring.<p>A smartphone launcher designed for older adults does not need to be boring. We aim to present technology that empowers older adults to enjoy using their smartphones. We have created this app for older adults with a stylish and intuitive interface. So, if your elderly loved ones find the current Android phone&#x27;s interface confusing and frustrating, the ONY app can help.<p>We hope you will give it a try. We value your feedback and look forward to updating the apps with necessary and useful features.",story,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silveractivities.onyphone&hl=en_US,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
