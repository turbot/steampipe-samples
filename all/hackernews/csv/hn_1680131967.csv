That&#x27;s simply unacceptable to me as a parent of two toddlers under the age of 2.<p>Medical &#x2F; Cost of a significant illness is really Fd up in this country. I had a kidney stone last year, and it cost me over 5k. Most of my friends &#x2F; family would not have been able to absorb that surprise expense and would have had to use credit cards. That&#x27;s not even much cash compared to what medical bills in the US can easily cost you.  Families are being financially ruined by this shit.<p>Lastly would be random, non-school violence. My wife is Asian and the increase in random asshats assaulting smaller, weaker people – esp Asian women – is just the latest WTF is going on in this country.<p>When I step back, it seems inevitable that someone close to me will suffer from one of the 3, or possible more than 1 of the 3 problems above.<p>I wonder if I would be better off just getting the hell out of the US before it gets worse. Maybe I&#x27;m being overly pessimistic here, but I don&#x27;t see a clear path forward to correct any of the above issues, except possible for #3 where stiffer crime sentences wouldn&#x27;t be completely unheard of. The other two, yeah those are never going to improve, and if anything they&#x27;re more likely to get worse. After the latest shooting in Nashville, of course the response is to FN loosen gun laws. Insanity.<p>Talk me off the ledge, or if you have already reached the same conclusion and moved to let&#x27;s say Canada, I would love to connect and learn how that went. I honestly don&#x27;t know where to begin.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
