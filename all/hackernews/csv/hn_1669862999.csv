33811355,Ask HN: Have you ever worked with a blockchain company that wasn't a scam?,2022-12-01T02:09:25Z,logicallee,6,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"<i>backstory: I&#x27;m sure this will sound familiar to a lot of you. Someone contacted me in response to a HN post I made seeking a role as a product manager. They contacted me for a position at a blockchain company. It was very hard to reach them by replying to their mail. After several attempts on my part, we finally got the ball rolling with Google meet meetings, agreeing on terms, adding me to the discord, etc. I met the team virtually, which gave me confidence that this could be something real. They had an interesting idea and I was keen to work with them to bring it to market. Then they started ghosting me, their discord went dead, they missed their meetings, mail went unanswered, and their front page has the same prominent typos as we talked about fixing in our first meetings. Now it feels like a scam, which sounds like what I&#x27;ve read about with several blockchain companies. I invoiced them but don&#x27;t really expect to be paid for the time I&#x27;ve spent working for them, chasing them for responses I never got and attending empty meetings they missed.</i><p>My question is, should I just blacklist any contact with blockchain companies? Have any of you ever worked with a blockchain company that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> a scam?<p>Everyone has their own standards but for me &quot;not a scam&quot; means that it delivered value to customers on par with a normal startup that doesn&#x27;t have blockchain anywhere in its name or offering.  i.e. if it is a blockchain shoe company, is anyone actually wearing a shoe they bought from them that they sold and shipped, like a non-blockchain shoe company would deliver.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

After I encountered the ID and face photo, the Stripe account manager told me that the identity verification could not be completed and that it was a Stripe bug,
We completed the Stripe application through Stripe Altas, and after five days of using Stripe, we were notified that the account was closed after submitting the ID and face photo.
Stripe asked us to provide proof of customer purchase, proof of shipping, and company documents, and we provided all of them.
However, after five days Stripe forced to return all the funds to the customer.
My Stripe account manager told me that this is currently a problem for non-US merchants using Stripe and that they don&#x27;t have the authority or level to fix the problem, so they can only tell us to wait.
Who can solve this problem? How long to wait?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Another wish of mine was for it to be a web extension that feels native to the browser vs an app extension that looks out of place.<p>After waiting long enough, I decided to build one myself. A little preview of Tap Tab - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taptab.manibatra.xyz"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taptab.manibatra.xyz</a>. The web extension APIs for managing tabs are pretty locked down in Safari, but I have already found a lot of value in using the extension. Some of the features that I find very useful(in the middle of building a few of these) :<p>- Driven by keyboard shortcuts. I can see the tabs I have open at a glance and switch between them.<p>- Fuzzy search to quickly filter down to the tab you want.<p>- Quick switching between two tabs.<p>- Ability to pin, mute, and close the tab right from the extension.<p>Say hello, and tell me what features you would like the extension to have!!
