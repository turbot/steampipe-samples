That&#x27;s why I created canicompostit.com - a simple and fast way to find out.<p>With Can I Compost It?, you can quickly search for any item and get a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer, along with some tips on how to compost it properly. My real-time database is constantly updated with new items (and if you search for something and it&#x27;s not in it, you can suggest it, then I research the item and add it to the DB). I included compost categories (brown or green) and references when applicable.<p>I first had the idea for this webapp years ago, and after some initial development, I posted it on Reddit (here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;lifehacks&#x2F;comments&#x2F;xicg1y&#x2F;find_out_"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;lifehacks&#x2F;comments&#x2F;xicg1y&#x2F;find_out_</a>...). The response was overwhelmingly positive, with people asking for additional features and thanking me for creating a useful tool. I took their feedback to heart and rebuilt the webapp from the ground up using Nuxt.js, Tailwind, and a Google Sheet database. The result is a lean and efficient webapp that&#x27;s easy to use and navigate.<p>Can I Compost It? is free to use and ad-free.<p>Keisaku said in the Reddit thread: &quot;This is the kindve site that makes me want to put a dedicated tablet in the kitchen.&quot;<p>Now this is something that motivates me! Admittedly, this is a one stone two bird project: I&#x27;m trying to create something useful and at the same time, use it as an excuse to hone my dev skills.<p>Next up, I&#x27;m working on a mobile app that will allow you to snap a picture of an item and instantly find out if it&#x27;s compostable. My goal is to make composting as easy and convenient as possible.<p>If you find it helpful, please share it with others who might benefit from it.<p>Thank you for your support!<p>Balint",story,https://canicompostit.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;d like to help him myself. I never worked on such a task, but always wanted. Time is not constrained, and I would learn along the way.<p>I was an asm then C game programmer for a decade but that was a while ago. Later as I worked as a sysadmin I refactored a jquery-php-mysql internal site and developed a ranking db backend with node and mongo. Then years passed.<p>I know I like simple tools and toolchains, and would go with php,ngx,sqlite,html,css,minimal js.
Php is the thing I&#x27;m most familiar with and the techempower results of the php-ngx-pg stack is fine for me.
I would choose Stripe to deal with money, and a Hetzner dedicated behind Cloudflare for hosting.<p>The unknows I see are signing in users with Google, working with Stripe and it&#x27;s mystic to me how would I let the user switch  commentary and background audio tracks on&#x2F;off. With SO around these will get resolved.
But reading HN I often come across vue, alpine, svelte, preact and see them usually praised and minimal but I have no idea if I need any of them or not.
Oh and do I need solutions like video.js or are html,css and js would do the job alone in 2023?
Do I need other sign up options besides Google and email for the targeted western audience?
Should I let &#x27;new&#x27; things like cloudflare workers take my attention?<p>And I wonder what are the unkowns I do not see?<p>Hmm, before you take your precious time to help me by answering my questions, let me note this as well.
While I like minimal dependencies and owning most of the codebase, I&#x27;m almost at 50 I do not really want to redevelop anything. Been there, done that. :) If there are stable and not that bloated building blocks or frameworks out there, I&#x27;am happy to use them.

35055843,Show HN: Bearer – Open-source code security scanning solution (SAST),2023-03-07T14:42:47Z,gmontard,8,false,false,1,[35055906],,,,"Hi HN,<p>we’re the co-founders of Bearer, and today we launch an open-source alternative to code security solutions such as Snyk Code, SonarQube, or Checkmarx. Essentially, we help security &amp; engineering teams to discover, filter and prioritize security risks and vulnerabilities in their codebase, with a unique approach through sensitive data (PII, PD, PHI).<p>Our website is at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bearer.com and our GitHub is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bearer&#x2F;bearer<p>We are not originally Security experts but have been software developers and engineering leaders for over 15 years now, and we thought we could provide a new perspective to security products with a strong emphasis on the developer experience, something we often found lacking for security tools.<p>In addition to building a true developer-friendly security solution, we’ve also heard a lot of teams complaining about how noisy their static code security solutions are. As a result, they often have difficulties triaging the most important issues, and ultimately it’s difficult to remediate them. We believe an important part of the problem lies in the fact that we lack a clear understanding of the real impact of any security issues. Without that understanding, it’s very difficult to ask developers to remediate critical security flaws.<p>We’ve built a unique approach to this problem, by looking at the impact of security issues through the lens of sensitive data. Interestingly, most security team ultimate responsibility today is to secure those sensitive data and protect their organization from costly data loss and leakage, but until today, that connection has never been made.<p>In practical terms, we provide a set of rules that assess the variety of ways known code vulnerabilities (CWE) ultimately impact your application security, and we reconcile it with your sensitive data flows. At the time of this writing, Bearer provides over 100 rules.<p>Here are some examples of what those rules can detect:
- Leakage of sensitive data through cookies, internal loggers, third-party logging services, and into analytics environments.
- Non-filtered user input that can lead to breaches of sensitive information.
- Usage of weak encryption libraries or misusage of encryption algorithms.
- Unencrypted incoming and outgoing communication (HTTP, FTP, SMTP) of sensitive information.
- Hard-coded secrets and tokens.
- And many you can find see here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.bearer.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;rules&#x2F;<p>Rules are easily extendable to allow you to create your own, everything is YAML based. For example, some of our early users used this system to detect the leakage of sensitive data in their backup environments or missing application-level encryption of their health data.<p>I’m sure you are wondering how can we detect sensitive data flows just by looking at the code. Essentially, we also perform static code analysis to detect those. In a nutshell, we look for those sensitive data flows at two levels:
- Analyzing class names, methods, functions, variables, properties, and attributes. It then ties those together to detected data structures. It does variable reconciliation etc.
- Analyzing data structure definitions files such as OpenAPI, SQL, GraphQL, and Protobuf.<p>Then we pass this over to a classification engine that assess 120+ data types from sensitive data categories such as Personal Data (PD), Sensitive PD, Personally identifiable information (PII), and Personal Health Information (PHI). All of that is documented here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.bearer.com&#x2F;explanations&#x2F;discovery-and-classification&#x2F;<p>As we said before, developer experience is key, that’s why you can install Bearer in 15 seconds, from cURL, Homebrew, apt-get, yum, or as a docker image. Then you run it as a CLI locally, or as part of your CI&#x2F;CD.<p>We currently support JavaScript and Ruby stacks, but more will follow shortly!<p>Please let us know what you think and check out the repo here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Bearer&#x2F;bearer",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
