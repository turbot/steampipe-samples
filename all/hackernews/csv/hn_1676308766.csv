We have not hired anyone via Linkedin yet but we kept the job post open as we have filtered through many candidates and they don&#x27;t get to apply again to the same job post and we were saving candidates for later stages. Anyways, our recruiter account got cancelled, all data was lost, job posting closed. Huge amount of man hours wasted and zero candidates to show. In other words, I did not get the service I paid for. Then their customer support rep offered to restore the data. They took a week to do it in which we had no job posted because he couldn&#x27;t answer whether the data restoration would affect the new job or not. Didn&#x27;t even bother to acknowledge the question. So data was restored, and surprise, it was absolutely useless. In this time it was established by Linkedin that our account got cancelled on unfounded claims. We talked to them about a refund and they are not even acknowledging the conversation, just skirting around it, completely ignoring it. Meanwhile, we started paying for Recruiter again and posted the job, two days later when we had enough candidates to start filtering them, our recruiter account got cancelled again. They said the profile picture is not yours.. it is 100% my co-founder&#x27;s photo and they already have his drivers license to prove it. So their software decodes to automatically cancel recruiter again, and refund it partially (minus the days it was used), and charged us for the marketing fees for the job of course, and here is the kicker, they did not cancel the job posting until about 3 days after the recruiter had already been cancelled, and continued to charge us for the marketing fees. Understand that we do not even have access to the recruiter account to do anything about this. Their customer rep is replying days later and is not even acknowledging any part of the conversation. Of course I will now have to file a chargeback considering they are not even cooperating. They have already run out the time for the back charge with their customer service shenanigans for the first two payments for this particular job post that I expect to get back which is around $1000CAD. The total amount owing is $2600-3000CAD. We are a startup funded by myself and my cofounder and every penny counts as we spend very efficiently. I am posting this here because I am an entrepreneur who is sick and tired of these types of companies who think they are entitled to do whatever they want, paying customers don&#x27;t matter to them, have predatory systems in place. I am writing this here to get to Linkedin employees, because if I worked at such a company, I would be against these practices and would want to know how to improve it. From the way things went for us, I highly doubt that their founder or anyone there cares at all. Marketshare will not always be yours.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
