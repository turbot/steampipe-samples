I&#x27;ve been brainstorming a &quot;Marketplace&quot; that would host community driven OKR templates that are deployable with a single click to the app. This pros to this are:<p>- Network effects
- Community
- More focused OKRs<p>With all the hype around AI however, I&#x27;m wondering if we should implement some Chat GPT type features to allow people to develop their OKRs that way. I don&#x27;t see many pros to this, but it might be a cool marketing gimmick. Some points I&#x27;ve considered:<p>- May be more seamless
- Expensive
- Not as community driven",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
