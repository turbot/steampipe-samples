35191199,Ask HN: Canadian Tax Implications of US Startup Shares Vesting,2023-03-17T00:48:33Z,cadtax_throw,1,false,false,1,[35191212],,,,"Hello,
I&#x27;m joining a startup as one of the first couple of  hires. Initially as an IC, but then as an employee, once global payroll is set up. I&#x27;m a Canadian citizen, resident in Canada, and working remotely. The company is a US corporation.<p>I&#x27;m trying to figure out my Canadian tax liability on the equity I&#x27;m receiving. This is restricted stock purchase award to purchase common stock, with a 1 year vesting cliff, and the remainder vesting fully over 4 years.<p>I&#x27;ve been advised by a CPA familiar with US&#x2F;Canadian tax that I fill out the 83(b) election for the IRS, but that the stocks will be treated as regular income at FMV, when they vest. This is concerning to me, depending on how FMV is calculated.<p>We just closed a seed round, which implicitly values the company. If we raise again in the next couple of years, is that new valuation the FMV for the shares vesting after that point, even though they&#x27;re completely illiquid? That&#x27;s what scares me.  I don&#x27;t want to be on the hook for 100&#x27;s of k in tax for something that I can&#x27;t generate any actual income from.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35191321,One week into open-sourcing my side project Isoflow,2023-03-17T01:01:58Z,markmanx,2,false,false,,,,,,"So it&#x27;s been around a week since making the initial commit to Isoflow&#x27;s public repo.  So how have things been going so far on the journey to open source?<p>For one I feel more accountable for getting this project over the line. 
 Isoflow has around 19 stars at the time of writing (at least I know there is some pull on the project, which is something I thrive on).  I&#x27;m splitting time between isoflow.io the site (which I&#x27;m rewriting at the same time - but which will probably be deprioritised), and the open-source diagram editor. There&#x27;s certainly a sense of my target market shifting from diagram makers to developers, who will care a lot more about the API design.  Pacing is super important, as a full-time engineering manager with two kids, I can (and want) to only set aside max a couple of hours a night to work on Isoflow. I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m majorly productive over those two hours (although today I&#x27;ve let time get away from me).<p>All in all, things are moving ahead.  I predict between 2 to 4 months to get to a v1.  You can track progress on the actual repo (I&#x27;ve just added a very simple roadmap in there as well).<p>I&#x27;ll be working to release Isoflow under the MIT license, you can find the start of the open-source project here at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markmanx&#x2F;isoflow (feel free to star!).

In a nutshell, gpt-repository-loader will spit out file paths and file contents in a prompt-friendly format. You can also use .gptignore to ignore files&#x2F;folders that are irrelevant to your prompt.<p>gpt-repository-loader as-is works pretty well in helping me achieve better responses. Eventually, I thought it would be cute to load itself into GPT-4 and have GPT-4 improve it. I was honestly surprised by PR#17. GPT-4 was able to write a valid an example repo and an expected output and throw in a small curveball by adjusting .gptignore. I did tell GPT the output file format in two places: 1.) in the preamble when I prompted it to make a PR for issue #16 and 2.) as a string in gpt_repository_loader.py, both of which are indirect ways to infer how to build a functional test. However, I don&#x27;t think I explained to GPT in English anywhere on how .gptignore works at all!<p>I wonder how far GPT-4 can take this repo. Here is the process I&#x27;m following for developing:<p>- Open an issue describing the improvement to make<p>- Construct a prompt - start with using gpt_repository_loader.py on this repo to generate the repository context, then append the text of the opened issue after the --END-- line.<p>- Try not to edit any code GPT-4 generates. If there is something wrong, continue to prompt GPT to fix whatever it is.<p>- Create a feature branch on the issue and create a pull request based on GPT&#x27;s response.<p>- Have a maintainer review, approve, and merge.<p>I am going to try to automate the steps above as much as possible.
