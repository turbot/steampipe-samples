33825975,Ask HN: Is there a search tool that indexes a curated subset of the web?,2022-12-02T02:29:58Z,peterth3,1,false,false,1,[33826012],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Sometimes find myself appending filters to my search queries, like “site:reddit.com”, “site:github.com”, and maybe even something like “site:x.com OR site:y.com OR z.com”. I know I’m not alone, because there was a discussion on here yesterday [0] where other devs shared that they’re doing the same thing.<p>From my limited view of the search engine market, I see see successful search companies exist on one side of two extremes. Either:<p>1. Index the entire web. This category would include companies like Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, ect.<p>Or<p>2. Index one website at a time. This would include companies like Algolia and Elasticsearch.<p>But there doesn’t seem to be any companies that focus on search use cases in between 1 and 2. As a software engineer it would be nice to have a search tool that only indexes sites like stack overflow, relevant GitHub repos, our dependencies’ docs, internal docs, and maybe a couple technical subreddits. I might even use this hypothetical search tool more than Google in my daily development work.<p>I’ve looked around for a search tool like I’m describing, but I can’t find anything that scratches my itch.<p>I did find YaCy [1], but it seems more technical and cumbersome than what I want. It’s focused more on other things like p2p&#x2F;decentralization. And, it looks like it’s been around for a while without much traction. But maybe my assessment is shortsighted..<p>Does anyone here know a search tool like I’m describing?<p>Or maybe this is is a Tarpit idea… If so, then why?<p>[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33799767

I understand non-tracking ads are comparatively ineffective, but can&#x27;t Meta insert fallback ads when their primary ad is blocked?<p>Even if there are technical limitations in doing this, from a high-level perspective, why is it not worth the effort for AdSense&#x2F;Meta to solve these limitations, so they can deliver fallback ads to end users?
