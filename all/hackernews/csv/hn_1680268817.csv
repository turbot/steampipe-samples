35386685,Ask HN: Can designers and devs overcome the challenges of a visually driven web?,2023-03-31T13:16:55Z,mikaelaast,1,false,false,,,,,,"I recently had a group discussion with my colleagues, and I felt a sense of unease as we talked about the challenges of web design. UX&#x2F;UI designers typically use visual tools like Figma or Sketch for creating web page mockups. While these tools offer valuable features, their primary focus on visual workflows can sometimes overshadow other crucial forms of communication.<p>In an ideal world, web design mockups would be conveyed through their native implementation, i.e., HTML&#x2F;CSS. However, text-based web design can feel counterintuitive for many designers, leading them to opt for visual tools. This preference, though understandable, can create a disconnect between design intent and final implementation, especially when it comes to accessibility for different types of users, such as those relying on screen readers.<p>During our discussion, I tried to emphasize that visually constructed mockups might not always convey the design rationale or intent clearly, and developers might struggle to decipher the design language from mockups alone. This can lead to value loss and challenges in creating accessible web experiences.<p>As I shared my concerns, I found it essential to highlight the potential pitfalls arising from the varied expertise of front-end developers. Whether they have a keen eye for visual language or focus on minor inconsistencies, the lack of clear design communication can result in misinterpretations and obstacles in achieving accessible design.<p>I gently expressed my concern that the visual web&#x27;s dominance might hinder our pursuit of creating inclusive web experiences. The improvements we seek in accessibility and the semantic web could be better realized by balancing visual freedom with systematic design descriptions.<p>It&#x27;s crucial to find a way to convey the importance of striking a balance between descriptive and visual elements in web design. The art of subtlety and restraint, once integral to text-based web design, can help create more accessible experiences for diverse users when appropriately applied.<p>How can we better communicate this need for bridging the gap between visual and systematic design communication, to enhance collaboration between designers and developers, and ultimately improve the web&#x27;s accessibility for all users?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
