We’re bringing a way to properly generate fake data in your database.<p>Wolebase allows you to connect your target database, analyze your database schema, propose a generation model based on your database requirements and directly insert data into your database. Thanks to this, we can manage constraints (such as foreign keys, primary keys, etc.), and propose generators based on your database types.<p>We built :<p>A desktop app that allows you to view and assign generators to your data types. We have maximized the configurations of each generator to allow for better control of the fake data generated. You can also view the preview of each column and adjust your generators accordingly.<p>For curious hackers, The Desktop app has been built with Tauri&#x2F;Rust and React.<p>A CLI tool that works with a specification file that is directly integrated into your code base like Prisma could do with its .prisma file. You can adapt the file to fit your data needs and then generate your data with the CLI by passing in your spec file.<p>The CLI is in the alpha phase and we are still working on improving the DX.<p>Currently, we are in public beta and we need users to test Wolebase and give us some feedback on it.<p>We hope you’ll like it and I’m happy to answer any questions&#x2F;feedback in the comments.",story,https://wolebase.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

My supervisor has assignmed me to learn SQL in 2 days. I&#x27;ve studied mysql in the past as well.
https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3schools.com&#x2F;sql&#x2F;
He has asked me to learn till SQL data types.
Are there any video courses to revise my sql using mysql? Remember that this is for customer support engineer job so I don&#x27;t require very vast knowledge of SQL, there&#x27;ll be DBAs for that.
I&#x27;m considering this course. Do tell me if I should buy it or not. This is by far the best course I&#x27;ve found.

35455170,Show HN: Iterate.World multiplayer AI image generator,2023-04-05T14:47:27Z,rgbrgb,5,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN, we’re Peter, Monica, Elliot, and Alex from Iterate.World. We’re building a multiplayer AI image generator.<p>Check it out here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iterate.world<p>We’ve become obsessed with generative AI. In the last year it feels like “AI” went from highly specialized, domain specific rankers and classifiers to intelligent feeling creative tools that we can build more general apps around.<p>While the models are incredible, it still feels like day 0 for applications and interface. Our vision is to build an accessible progressive disclosure interface that lets beginners make great images then learn from experts making masterpieces. We hope playing with the image generator feels a bit like tinkering with a synth… you’ll discover a phrase that gives your images a special tone, riff on it, then file it away in a preset for later.<p>FEATURES<p>- Streams: Streams are workspaces where you can iterate on an image or theme. Streams have presets.<p>- Presets: presets like —trip, —photog, —graphite are like stylistic configurations for the image generator (like a preset on a synthesizer). You can make your own for the community to use. This gives iterate prompts a shared command language that users can change.<p>- GPT-powered prompt completion: type a few words and see what GPT thinks could make it a good prompt. As your stream progresses, it will make suggestions based on the most liked images in the stream. This was a fun feature to build. More on that in this tweet: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_0_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1641854387759743001<p>TECH<p>Under the hood we use DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion (1.5 and 2.1), Openjourney V2, and Material Stable Diffusion for image generation. We use ChatGPT for pre-processing prompts and surfacing completions in the UI. You can configure the model per prompt or per stream with --commands. Before you ask, the Midjourney image generator is incredible and if they release an API, we’ll integrate immediately. If there are other engines you want to play with, let us know.<p>OPEN<p>Prompts are always displayed below images and presets always show the configuration so you can copy and improve them. We’re also strong advocates of open source and our last project was an open source devtool. At some point we’d like to open source Iterate.World but as maintainers we know that having an open codebase and fielding community questions incurs a big time cost that we’re not ready to take on yet.<p>WHAT NEXT<p>Broadly: better tools to make better images and tools for better making together. I love audio samplers (e.g. MPC, digitakt, sp404, ableton) and I think of the AI image generators a lot like samplers. They provide an interface where you can take a lot of existing work and mash it together in interesting ways. In that regard, I think a lot about how we can make Iterate.World feel more “musical”, how we can improve the workflow for live collaboration and let you go further with your creations.<p>Thanks for taking a look, excited to see what ya’ll make! LMK if you have questions or suggestions.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
