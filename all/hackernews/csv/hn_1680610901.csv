I&#x27;ve been working on an experimental tool that helps you use GPT to work on your codebase. I&#x27;d love to improve the tool if there&#x27;s interest. New ideas welcome! I think this could also be useful for experimenting with other types of recursive prompts.<p>It’s a little bit Swiss Army knife and a little bit skynet:<p>[<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ferrislucas&#x2F;promptr](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ferrislucas&#x2F;promptr)"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ferrislucas&#x2F;promptr](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;f...</a><p>From the README:
Promptr is a CLI tool for operating on your codebase using GPT. Promptr dynamically includes one or more files into your GPT prompts, and it can optionally parse and apply the changes that GPT suggests to your codebase. Several prompt templates are included for various purposes, and users can create their own templates.",story,https://github.com/ferrislucas/promptr,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35438051,Tell HN: I asked ChatGPT4 to compare baseball fans in East Asia and USA,2023-04-04T11:40:32Z,graderjs,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello! In East Asia, particularly in Taiwan and Japan, attending baseball games is a popular pastime. Fans often engage in various activities to support their teams and enjoy the overall experience. Here, I&#x27;ll provide you with information about acceptable fan behaviors, including eating and drinking in the stands.<p>Taiwan:<p>In Taiwan, baseball is the most popular sport, and attending games is a significant social event. Fans are generally allowed to bring their own food and drinks, including beer, into the stadiums, although some may also sell food and beverages on-site. At the stadiums, you can find a variety of local snacks and drinks, such as Taiwanese sausages, fried noodles, and bubble tea. Beer is available for purchase at the stadium as well. Fans in Taiwan are known for their enthusiastic cheering, singing, and chanting, and they often wave banners and flags to show support for their favorite teams.<p>Japan:<p>Japanese baseball games are similar to those in Taiwan, with a lively atmosphere and enthusiastic fans. In Japan, it&#x27;s common for fans to eat and drink in the stands. Stadiums usually offer a wide range of food options, including the traditional hotdogs, as well as Japanese treats like sushi, bento boxes, and takoyaki (octopus balls). Beer is available at stadiums and can be purchased from vendors known as &quot;beer girls,&quot; who walk around the stands with kegs on their backs, serving drinks to fans. Japanese fans also have their own unique cheering style called &quot;ouendan,&quot; which involves coordinated chanting, singing, and clapping, often led by a cheer captain.<p>Comparison with the USA:<p>In the United States, consuming food and beverages, including beer and hotdogs, is an integral part of the baseball experience. Stadiums typically offer a wide range of food options, from classic snacks like hotdogs, nachos, and popcorn to more gourmet options in some cases. Beer is also widely available at stadiums, with vendors walking through the stands or stationed at concession stands. American fans tend to be more individualistic in their cheering, with spontaneous reactions to the game&#x27;s events rather than coordinated chants like in Japan.<p>In conclusion, enjoying food and beverages, including beer and snacks, is an accepted part of the baseball experience in both Taiwan and Japan, as well as the United States. Fans in East Asia are generally more organized and coordinated in their cheering, whereas American fans tend to react more spontaneously. Regardless of the country, attending a baseball game is a fun and exciting experience, often accompanied by lively fan participation and a sense of camaraderie among supporters.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
