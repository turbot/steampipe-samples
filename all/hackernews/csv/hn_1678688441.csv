While some argue that we&#x27;ve been in a gold rush for decades, others see the potential for opportunities just beginning to emerge. As someone who wants to build something in this space, I believe in the value of tapping into the collective knowledge of the tech community. Though I&#x27;m aware that some may not want to give away their secrets, I still hope to learn from those who are willing to share their insights.<p>One useful framework for approaching the uncertainties and opportunities of this space is to consider not just the first-order effects of changes, but also the second-order effects. For example, the gig economy has created a need for simplified accounting apps for individuals who are essentially running their own businesses. By considering second-order effects, we can develop more comprehensive strategies for approaching this new gold rush.<p>While content creators and indie makers may offer some useful insights, I believe that the tech community can come together to share experiences and insights and build a community that supports each other&#x27;s growth and success in the AI space. Let&#x27;s work together to develop more effective frameworks and strategies and make the most of the opportunities presented in this new gold rush.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
