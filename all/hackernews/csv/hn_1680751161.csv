35463450,Ask HN: How can I get hired when I am now tired of being competitive?,2023-04-06T02:41:12Z,reactreflux1,2,false,false,3,"[35463623,35463573,35463538]",,,,"I no longer feel motivated to compete. Maybe I just need to  get back the motivation but I don&#x27;t know how. The mass layoffs weren&#x27;t even the tipping point for me. Even when the market for tech jobs was healthier, the whole process of interviewing felt unforgiving and sweaty. And this doesn&#x27;t include the FAANG-type companies, just the more mundane ones.<p>I&#x27;ve been applying to jobs non-stop since 2021 and interviewed at many places, and getting no offers. I faced the burnout sometime early last year. I don&#x27;t have a job, yet the stakes still feel low for me right now.
Even for the more &quot;chill&quot; jobs you are expected to pass multiple rounds, and be the best among the candidates.<p>Just being a finalist isn&#x27;t good enough to pass, it seems. I would prefer to avoid this criteria of placing first and still find a means of getting hired. For an average developer job, I just want to have an average mindset, not very competitive, where being average among the interview candidates is already considered &quot;good enough&quot;.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
