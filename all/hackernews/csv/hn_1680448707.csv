MoonPier enables creators to pre-sell NFTs using ETH, instead of simply collecting a whitelist before an NFT launch.<p>Over the past three months, my friends and I have created multiple NFT collections with less-than-stellar sales results. We wondered if there could be a Kickstarter-like platform, it would save us on deployment fees before achieving &quot;collection market fit&quot;.<p>MoonPier is now live on the Sepolia testnet!
