35227730,Ask HN: Where are the QR codes to swap contact info?,2023-03-20T05:45:10Z,andrewfromx,1,false,false,,,,,,Does anyone know of an app trying to solve this problem:<p>You want to give your phone number to someone you just met. The humans have to exchange the digits by talking or typing. One phone should display a QR the other phone scans and the phone number gets inserted into contacts just like that.<p>i.e. the QR should have all the info of a VCard:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;VCard<p>I&#x27;ve googled around and found stuff like:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flexibits.com&#x2F;cardhop<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scanbizcards.com&#x2F;<p>but it should be much easier. In iOS the wallet app should have several vCards of your self. You want to give someone your main cell number + name + email that&#x27;s one wallet item. You want to give someone just your google voice number + name and no email that&#x27;s another.<p>And built into iOS and Android should be if the camera scans these it knows to auto insert into contacts. We use QR&#x27;s for everything else! Why are we still printing business cards to be scanned or giving out a 10 digit number by speaking?,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
