I basically want to make a full computer in the spirit of LISP machines. I know how ambitious it is but I really want to try.<p>I am wondering whether I should stop procrastinating and just proceed with Verilog right now, or try a more modern language like Clash or SpinalHDL first though. I do not know anything about Scala and only have a basic idea of Haskell.<p>People who have used an &quot;alternative&quot; HDL, how has your experience been? Are there any major disadvantages and pain points? Is the produced code efficient and robust? Were the readability and productivity gains worth it? What about device primitives?<p>Anything you could share on the matter would be appreciated!<p>EDIT: I decided to just get started with Verilog now, see how it goes and reconsider a rewrite along the way, which I &#x27;ll definitely do if it&#x27;s worth it.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
