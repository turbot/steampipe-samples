- a CSS parser with bison and flex compiled with an AST written in zig :-)
- a single-person flat-file matrix server :-))<p>These are examples of projects I want to do, either for myself or someone else. It&#x27;s not paid work for me and I just want those projects to be done and be open source.<p>After almost two decades of trying out things for myself and teaching myself programming that way, I grew tired of that and just want to get on with the projects I have in mind without wasting hours away on tasks that someone else could have solved for me way faster.
(especially with the libreoffice xslt project, because the xslt export filter stuff just isn&#x27;t documented anywhere)<p>It&#x27;s not really a matter of how much it would cost me, since I just want to get those projects done and go on from there. That (hopefully) doesn&#x27;t take that much people-hours that I&#x27;d come out broke from there. :-)<p>I&#x27;ve heard about upwork and fiverr and the like. But I don&#x27;t know which of those platforms would give me the least amount of trouble with finding people for that sort of tasks. Or if I should go about this completely different, I don&#x27;t know. Need some input and guidance.<p>Or do I have to found a non-profit VC and ask on HN for hire? :-)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
