Once added it cannot be modified, edited or removed from the chain.<p>there are more features to the blockchain, I would like to focus on these and ask, what would be the point of me using this?<p>So the decentralization is nice in theory but all Blockchains are in the end hosted in big cloud providers. Why? Because it gets ridiculously large because of the blockchain and updating everything. The transactions between the different blockchains is also super slow. especially if there are multiple things that need to be appended.<p>So what I see is I have a DB which is scattered, huge and slow.<p>So can someone elaborate this to me?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
