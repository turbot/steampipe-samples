34854463,LogMeIn/Goto Hamachi was hacked,2023-02-19T04:37:07Z,lionkor,2,false,false,,,,,,"Dear Customer,<p>I am writing to update you on our ongoing investigation about the security incident we told you about in November 2022.<p>Our investigation to date has determined that a threat actor exfiltrated encrypted backups related to Hamachi from a third-party cloud storage facility. In addition, we have evidence that a threat actor also exfiltrated an encryption key for a portion of the encrypted data. However, as part of our security protocols, we salt and hash Hamachi account passwords. This provides an additional layer of security within the encrypted backups.<p>Recommended Actions 
Out of an abundance of caution, we are resetting your Hamachi password. If you use Multi-Factor Authentication to sign into your Hamachi account, you may be prompted to update your Multi-Factor Authentication settings during this process.<p>As an additional step to protect you, your account will automatically be migrated to GoTo’s enhanced Identity Management Platform as part of your password reset. This platform provides additional security for your users with more robust authentication and login-based security options, including enhanced controls, stronger password requirements, and a Single Sign-On option to access multiple GoTo (LogMeIn) products. Note: all users who have reset their password since December 12 have already been moved to the new platform and do not need to take this action. Additional guidance can be found here.<p>What information was affected 
The information in the affected backups include your Hamachi account usernames and salted and hashed passwords. It also includes your deployment and provisioning information, some Multi-Factor Authentication information, licensing and purchasing data such as user emails, phone numbers, billing addresses, and the last four digits of credit card numbers (we do not store full credit card or bank details).<p>Based on our investigation to date, we continue to believe that the threat actor did not have access to GoTo’s production systems. Furthermore, Hamachi’s peer-to-peer technology and end-to-end encryption provide security against interception and eavesdropping of data transferred during remote sessions. Your session data in transit is always protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2.<p>While the investigation is ongoing, we wanted to provide this important update to you, and recommend clear and actionable steps in response to what we have learned. We are committed to protecting you, your information, and the security of our products and will continue to update you. If you have any additional questions, please contact customer support.<p>Paddy Srinivasan
