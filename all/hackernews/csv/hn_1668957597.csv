33681263,Help HN: Starlink Signup Indistinguishable from a Scam,2022-11-20T14:47:43Z,childintime,36,false,false,8,"[33681383,33681370,33681381,33681510,33681452]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"On october 27th, when I first heard about Starlink for RV&#x27;s, I immediately signed up at starlink.com and paid €480. I filled in my email and my phone number, but to date I have not received a confirmation of receipt from Starlink. The payment was a direct transfer.<p>I have gone through the (not great) starlink support pages, and one can apparently only contact starlink through an account that becomes available through the confirmation email. Naturally I have none. It also states that if that confirmation email wasn&#x27;t confirmed, the order would be cancelled after 7 days (it hasn&#x27;t). There was no email in my Spam folder.<p>Now it&#x27;s been over 3 weeks. I am a customer but as far as starlink is concerned, I am not. They obviously did their utmost best to not need a helpdesk, having generous procedures in place for when things fail. There is no one to talk to, not even a silly bot. This is all great when it works, but when you fall on the side where things don&#x27;t work as intended, as I do now, it doesn&#x27;t exactly feel great. It feels like a scam, it&#x27;s indistinguishable.<p>There is also a potential for a scam. If I somehow filled in a slightly wrong email address someone else could, in theory, have taken over my account, and could have redirected the shipment. The point is, I&#x27;ll never know, and I was not made aware of such risk while signing up. Indeed the signup experience was strangely feed-forward, without an email-confirmation step. In the end it felt like I was supposed to dump €480 into a void, with nothing to show for, except a bank transfer. Just like in a scam I was forced to rely on the reputation of the brand, only. This could have been a scam, except this is standard policy.<p>I think the above is a relevant data-point to many of you (non-scammers), because it represents an extreme case, even beyond Google, one where not only the non-fallability of software artifacts is presumed, but also the non-fallability of the organizational process that led to its 100% no-contact design.<p>That&#x27;s sure to have some relevance to the community, but of course I just want someone to talk to and solve what could have been the smallest of issues. Any advice on how to proceed next is appreciated.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I haven’t seen that in any APIs we use. They give you uniform endpoints, somewhat similar data structures but they are never uniform and you have to write blockchain-specific code to get the information you look for. I understand that they might want to return data for all transactions - and you can’t do that reasonably well for all blockchains in uniform format. But I think they do not understand what their customers care about - the value transfers, not a bunch of misc transactions.<p>Another thing that bothered me in existing API services - they don’t let you interact with their API through your browser. You can’t have a quick glance at how responses look like. First you have to sign up, then get a token and finally either POST to the endpoint or include an api key in request headers.
