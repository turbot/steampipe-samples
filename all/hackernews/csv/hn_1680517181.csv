35420936,Show HN: A high-level sprint calendar for checking dates at a glance,2023-04-03T09:57:29Z,cknight,1,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;m the product manager for a couple of dev teams, and sometimes need to quickly check where certain future dates fall with our 3-weekly sprint cadence. Neither Outlook&#x27;s calendar nor our org&#x27;s internally hosted Jira instance makes this easy to determine at a glance - the latter I can&#x27;t even access from my phone.<p>I built something so I can always have a high-level view of our sprint dates on hand when I&#x27;m in meetings - stakeholders discussing milestones, team members asking about time off, or upcoming change freeze windows. I figure it might be useful for others, and I was surprised to find this .com domain available, so I nabbed it for sharing.<p>You can see one of my team&#x27;s sprints and releases here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sprintcalendar.com&#x2F;3-week-sprints&#x2F;start-2023-03-23&#x2F;release+4&#x2F;view-now"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sprintcalendar.com&#x2F;3-week-sprints&#x2F;start-2023-03-23&#x2F;r...</a>. This bookmarked view won&#x27;t need to change as time goes on, unless of course my team decides to change or reset its cadence.<p>It has a few limitations, and likely wouldn&#x27;t be too useful for teams whose sprints or releases are attached to calendar months instead of weeks. However my last team&#x27;s &quot;First Sunday of the month&quot; release model was not hard to keep track of in my head.<p>Feedback welcome!",story,https://sprintcalendar.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
