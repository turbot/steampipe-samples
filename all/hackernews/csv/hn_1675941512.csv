34722220,Ask HN: Is anyone else getting AI fatigue?,2023-02-09T10:58:47Z,graderjs,2,false,false,,,,,,"AI is great. ChatGPT is incredible. But I feel tired when I see so many new products being built that incorporate AI in some way, like &quot;AI for this...&quot; &quot;AI for that...&quot; I think it misapplies AI. But more than that, it&#x27;s just too much. Right? Right? Anyone else feel like this? Everything is about ChatGPT, AI, prompts or startups we can build with that. It&#x27;s like the crypto craze all over again, and I&#x27;m a little in dread of the shysters again, the waste, the opportunity cost of folks pursuing this like a mad crowd rather than being a little more thoughtful about where to go next.
