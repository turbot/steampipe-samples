Long time ago I have learned that<p><pre><code>     log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)
</code></pre>
and that this was used by Napier to multiply numbers. Also I knew that matrix multiplication time is dominated by inner dot products, which use addition and multiplication.<p>And it just stuck me today, that it is possible to multiply matrices in logarithmic space (that is, matrix values are logs of real values) without multiplication! By using same trick Napier did.<p>(There are restrictions, as negative values produce complex logarithms. So it has to be handled carefully)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
