This website catalogued at least interviews a person has appeared in, podcast appearances, articles written by and tweets (likely scraped from their profile; I block the Twitter domains at the DNS level). At least +200 votes, quite certainly.<p>From what I recall, seemingly was mostly focused on people working on various fields of science and research. I (only) remember that John Carmack (the co-founder of id Software, later at Oculus VR) had a page there.<p>I <i>had</i> the website bookmarked, but when accessing not-so-long-time after the HN submission all links appeared to be redirecting to the frontpage and I got the impression that their project had morphed into something else entirely or was in the process of winding down.
