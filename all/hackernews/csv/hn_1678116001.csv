The system uses advanced automatic speech recognition and translation technology, which can automatically identify the language of the participants, and translate the language spoken by other participants into your preferred language in real time and display it as text. We have verified that the system can display text smoothly and in near real time in meetings with up to 45 people in multiple languages. The system can be used in various occasions, such as international conferences, business negotiations, online education, etc. We&#x27;re looking for developers with a passion for speech recognition and natural language processing to join our team as we continue to improve the system and bring it to the wider market. At the same time, we are also looking for a more stable message distribution method to ensure that the system can continue to operate efficiently.
We hope more people can experience the power of this system and provide valuable suggestions and feedback. We have established a complete sales system, if you are a channel partner and can help us achieve commercialization, we will share our achievements and profits with you. We believe that the system has huge market potential and can meet the communication needs between different languages around the world and become a bridge for transnational communication. We sincerely invite people with lofty ideals to join our team to promote the development and promotion of the system and benefit more people.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
