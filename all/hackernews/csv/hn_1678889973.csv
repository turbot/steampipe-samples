I tried to look for a contact email or phone number for booking.com. There isn&#x27;t one. You can contact the property, you can try and get in touch with your bank but if there is a problem with booking.com, there&#x27;s no one you can contact, not that I could find at least, I&#x27;m more than happy to be proven wrong. The contact us page has only links to other issues and their FAQ, but no one can tell me why after I changed my email account on my account, I&#x27;m getting confirmation emails and notifications to my old email account.<p>Moving on.<p>Airbnb - same sort of moronic chatbot that can&#x27;t help you with anything. You can contact the property or the person you wish to book with, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Gmail? Well, you&#x27;re not paying for this, so why do you want a contact us page? What if you do, who do you contact then?<p>Google Cloud? Apparently it doesn&#x27;t matter if you pay, you still have to roll the dice on Twitter&#x2F;HN&#x2F;Reddit to get someone to &quot;call a guy&quot;.<p>Twilio? They don&#x27;t have a contact number (is this what irony is?), same &quot;chatbot&quot; as Airbnb.<p>Outlook? I was in the middle of writing an email, logged into my account and when I tried to send it, I got a warning saying that my account is suspicious and that I need to verify it. So now I needed to go to another machine, I couldn&#x27;t sign in anymore on the one I was writing the email on. On the new machine I had to provide a phone number to verify my account, a new phone number. How is this verification? If someone took my account and they have access to my account + password, you giving them carte blanche to provide ANY phone number, doesn&#x27;t secure my account. On the part of why I was using an outlook email account - you can&#x27;t complete Microsoft certifications and use another account as a certification email address...<p>Pearson Vue - I&#x27;m emailing their support back and forth to get a refund for a deposit I had to pay on an exam. Apparently, their automated system showed that I did not take part in the exam. However, they did take a picture of me, I had my passing certificate, I had gone through their verification and they had harvested all the data they could about me, yet in all of this, there wasn&#x27;t some sort of flag to say &quot;Took Test y&#x2F;n&quot;.<p>Where are we going with this? What sort of systems are we building where we are gleefully cutting out services in order to maximize profits. I understand that we somehow all agreed that customer service and support is something you shouldn&#x27;t expect from free things. But what about the stuff you do pay for? What about the automation of EVERYTHING because companies are so obsessed with not hiring 10-100 people for support that they create these hell-holes where you can easily end up locked out of your account even when you have the same system, on the same network and the username&#x2F;password&#x2F;2FA available?<p>Are we really accepting this? Is this really normal behavior?<p>I for one will go out of my way to book trips directly with the people&#x2F;companies I will be staying with. I&#x27;m tired of your poor excuses for &quot;removing friction&quot;, I&#x27;m tired of the excuses saying &quot;well, how are you going to support 1 billion users?&quot; I don&#x27;t know. You figure it out. If you can&#x27;t do it, shut down your service. Charge money. I really don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m tired of being the one that has to answer that question, I don&#x27;t run the company.<p>What I&#x27;m curious is what have been your experiences with these systems. What do you see as ways forward.
