Tuesday night.. or, more precisely, Tuesday, Jan 31st 8:52pm if you ever care..<p>_____________________<p>I entered my home, exhausted, with my eyes blinking in slow-motion, probably around 1fps, I stared at my five-monitor setup PC in the hope I could wake it up to resume some work, my brain tried to revive my body, but all it received was a weird response with a status code of 700, which translates to &quot;EXHAUSTED&quot; in plain English! &quot;Okay then&quot;, I said, &quot;my body also has the right to rest&quot; and, even though it’s been more than two years (as I recall) since I didn’t go to bed at this timing, I decided to break this and go to sleep, with a catch! And, it’s this &quot;catch&quot; that made me write this post.<p>I looked at the bed, then turned to look at the couch, or, honestly, the couch&#x2F;pillow&#x2F;phone combo. Suddenly, the epic cinematic scene of &quot;Final Duel&quot; from &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; starts playing in my head. I was obliged to make a tough decision about which to choose, the bed or the couch, but it turned out that it wasn’t that hard as the couch pulled its gun and &quot;shot the bed in the head&quot; in a 50ms timeframe, followed by a moment of silence ________ &quot;Good shot!&quot;, my brain said.. Then it sent an executive order to my body to rest on the couch and take the phone. Surprisingly, the request was executed without complaint.<p>I laid on the couch, took my phone, unlocked it, stared into its apps, and said: &quot;What can I do for a few minutes before I go to bed?&quot; I looked at a HackerNews app and said, &quot;Oh no, I am on low- capacity, I can’t read technical articles or add valuable comments&quot;. Reddit, not in the mood. Twitter, not today. Google Discover, will.. but tomorrow maybe. YouTube, well, maybe Yes, why not?! Then I tapped on the &quot;red&quot; play icon.<p>Youtube started recommending my favorite types of content (gadget reviews, programming, cars, geopolitics..), I started scrolling down, but, because I was in an extra power-saving mode, I quickly realized I was not being able to consume any content that would make my brain spin,  even for a millisecond! I just wanted to watch some brainless content.. Then, for the first time in my life, I intentionally clicked on &quot;Shorts&quot; to watch a few quick videos. My brain yelled: &quot;Heeere.. we go!&quot;<p>It was relaxing, effortless, dopaminy and.. too time-consuming! My -supposedly- exhausted body suddenly stopped reporting the tiredness it had a few moments ago, I completely lost track of time; the only thing that interrupted me was the phone’s battery draining to 2%. I quickly brought the charger, plugged the phone in, and laid again on that &quot;metaversey&quot; couch. I’ve already spent an imaginary amount of time watching, considering my initial body’s state. The clock had already passed midnight!! I was swapping for more than three hours straight without a signal from my brain to stop; it was the complete opposite; my brain was telling me to swipe more and more, and I didn’t say no until.. I got another urgent interruption. My brain signaled that there was a quantity of &quot;used water&quot; that my body no longer needs and should get rid of, right now! I executed the task and returned quickly.. it was then, 2am!<p>I resumed watching, and... kept watching. I don’t even recall if my eyes were blinking or not. I was happy. My body was producing large amounts of dopamine to keep me in &quot;nirvana&quot; but.. after a while, I started noticing my eyes’ blinking in slo-mo. My lovely brain agreed to end this session, so I laid my &quot;exhausted&quot; body on the bed, and then, in just a few seconds, I lost my consciousness. It was.. well, 4:48am!!<p>The following day, I kept thinking about what happened to me that night but didn’t find an answer? I asked: &quot;Was I really tired at 8:52pm?&quot;, Absolutely, yes! &quot;Was I able to work instead of watching YT?&quot; No way! So, where did all of this energy was coming from? I don’t know. All I know is: <i>&quot;Now, I know what the effect of short-form video is&quot;</i>",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
