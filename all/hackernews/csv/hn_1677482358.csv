Anyone else feel this way sometimes?
Like how we all care about bits and bytes but not people and bikes?<p>Why do we all live like this, why don&#x27;t we all hang out in a coffee shop instead of on blogs i guess we are too far apart too busy and its hard to find people with similar interests near you with similar schedules.
It&#x27;s actually nice though to talk without needing to be in person its like mailing through post, you have time to think.<p>This site is Literally epic guys keep it up. But at the same time why don&#x27;t you loosen up a bit you know like we are all going to be dead why do you have to be so professional all the time?  I guess that&#x27;s just this site specifically. But I think some of you are emotionally unavailable people. Or maybe you are so in touch with reality that this is how humans sound with no ego. 
But why can&#x27;t we be silly sometimes like just say random things for no reason but it feels like it is always like business time here.<p>Its like striving for perfection through good software design because why ? Solving problems is good i suppose. I don&#x27;t know i guess people here seem pretty well rounded got some hobbies and all that so it isn&#x27;t like we are all addicted to coding and shit.<p>I both hate and love this site is what i&#x27;m saying, it represents the hard-worker nerd anti-social side which is just hardwired to finding optimal solutions. but my other social side resents it because it is so meaningless compared to real social connections I have had in life like my childhood friends and my partner. we already have everything we need, what if all these software guys starting building more housing to help out with the crisis happening across the world. There are huge labour shortages but i suppose they should simply pay more to fill the gap?<p>Why don&#x27;t we use our brains to not program shitty webdev and Iot devices, but study and model the economy and system and understand exactly why and where the worst issues are happening and tackle those. not a lot of funding for this i guess.<p>anyways i am dumb have a good day.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
