Basically, I was incredibly insecure and this led me to always try to do things on my own. This didn&#x27;t really change until I started jiu-jistu.<p>Anyways, I was able to get my first job out of college at a top university. I met some amazing people there. But really held back from socializing much, because I wanted to do well at my very menial job.<p>A couple times colleagues tried to include me on projects, but I politely just focused on my work. Now many of them are leading very successful startups that I could&#x27;ve likely been an early employee at.<p>I ended up working at 2 failed startups (I got from cold applying), and have failed about 20 times building a side hustle of my own.<p>I feel like I needed to go through some struggle, but I can&#x27;t help but regret my choices. I need a win badly. I have worked very hard and built nothing. I also lost a lot of money gambling but have since quit.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Their customer service explained this is limited to android phones, so if I switch to apple,I can use their app. I am not switching phones just to get a coffee.
