In fact, relying too heavily on AWS and not understanding the fundamentals of cloud computing can lead to a number of issues and challenges.<p>One problem with the &quot;just use AWS&quot; mentality is that it can create a lack of understanding and appreciation for the underlying principles and technologies of cloud computing. AWS is a complex and sophisticated platform, and using it effectively requires an understanding of its various components and capabilities, as well as an understanding of the broader context of cloud computing. Without this understanding, it can be difficult to make informed decisions about how to use AWS and how to optimize its performance and costs.<p>Another issue with the &quot;just use AWS&quot; mentality is that it can lead to a lack of flexibility and adaptability. AWS is not the only cloud platform available, and there are many other options that may be better suited to specific needs and requirements. By focusing solely on AWS, organizations may miss out on the benefits and advantages of other platforms, and they may be unable to easily switch to another platform if the need arises.<p>Additionally, the &quot;just use AWS&quot; mentality can create a lack of awareness of the potential risks and limitations of AWS. AWS is not a perfect platform, and it has its own set of challenges and limitations. For example, AWS is not immune to downtime, outages, or security breaches, and it can be affected by various external factors such as internet connectivity and power outages. By not understanding these risks and limitations, organizations may be unprepared for potential disruptions or problems that can arise when using AWS.<p>Overall, while AWS is a powerful and popular cloud platform, it is not the answer to everything. The &quot;just use AWS&quot; mentality can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the fundamentals of cloud computing, a lack of flexibility and adaptability, and a lack of awareness of the potential risks and limitations of AWS.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
