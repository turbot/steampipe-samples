He tried every available means to regain access — to no avail. He runs a page with tens of thousands of followers supporting teachers who are striking against low wages and unjustified retributions across Hungary. He is worried that the Hungarian government might have requested pressured Facebook to suspend his account.<p>Can anyone help?<p>------------<p>Dear Artem, dear Business Support Team,<p>I am not sure if this email reaches you. Please assist me in resolving a very worrying login issue: I was automatically logged out of all my desktop Facebook apps last Thursday (fb.com&#x2F;szabolcskincse&#x2F;). I tried to log back in straight away, however, I have not received any text messages with the two-factor identification code I need to get back into my account. Right now I am only logged in from my phone app (Version 1.0 393.0.0.29.111 (419440540), and this does not allow me to access the two-factor identification screen.<p>Ever since Thursday I have not received any text messages from Facebook, the codes are not arriving, and I went through all the possibilities offered by the help center. I, via a colleague, managed to liaise with an agent, Petra, who seem to have given up on this issue.<p>Since I need to access Ads Manager and Business manager daily for multiple clients, it is imperative for me to be able to get into my account (not mentioning all my private data). Also, most worryingly, I cannot run ads for the Democratic Union of Teachers who is spearheading a national strike right now. It is a highly political issue with much national and international attention, and many colleagues and political figures suspect foul play, especially in the light of the recent suspension of the PDSZ ads account. The promotion of PDSZ content is crucial in the efforts of the teachers in order to achieve their goals in their struggle against the government for high pay and freedom to protest (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;hungarians-widen-protests-over-teachers-pay-cost-of-living-crisis-deepens-2022-11-18&#x2F;).<p>Please, try to contact me and solve this problem, so that I can either start receiving confirmation codes again via text on my mobile phone (+36 20 851 8384), or I can receive my confirmation codes via other means (my email is s.kincse@gmail.com). The issue is even more mysterious, as the other option, the automatic call does also not take place when I chose that.<p>I am looking forward to your reply,<p>Szabolcs Kincse",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
