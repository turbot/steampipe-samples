I like lightweight, I don&#x27;t like (more like hate) packages that force me into a certain development pattern which is why I don&#x27;t care much for Hydra or pytorch-lightning. 
If you like me, just want to load config from a yaml file and also automatically overrride it from the command line when required, try out my above python package. Any feedback is appreciated too.

I was sent over here by some folks on Discord who told me that this was a good place to get advice from a knowledgeable group, so I hope you don&#x27;t mind me staring my story.<p>About a year ago now, I completed a Full Stack Web bootcamp. This entire year I have been submitting resumes, developing skills, building projects, working on my portfolio etc, but have gotten little traction as far as getting a job. The few interviews i&#x27;ve been given usually go fairly well, but result in being ghosted. I understand that this is normal, it&#x27;s just that I get granted an interview so infrequently, it feels like much more of a blow.<p>A bit about myself. I am 39. I have been computer literate ever since we got our Macintosh LC when I was a little kid. I have been working mostly automotive jobs as an adult, some of which gave me the opportunity to do some things like build a fuel system controller, and do factory automation. Throughout the last 10 years or so I had wanted to get serious about moving into software engineering as a career, which is why I did a boot camp. Regardless of your opinion on these courses, I feel that I got what I needed out of it and have been further developing my skills ever since being done.<p>I have (from what i&#x27;ve been told) a decent portfolio and body of work. I feel my interview performance is adequate for a junior level position. Where I feel the problem lies is that my resume just isn&#x27;t doing what I need it to. I have a couple jobs that could be considered relevant, but with huge gaps in between when I worked not so relevant jobs. If I were to accurately represent my work history, my resume would be 2 pages long. I also don&#x27;t have a college degree. I&#x27;ve heard opinions ranging from &quot;Jobs only care what you are capable of&quot; to &quot;It&#x27;s possible, but extremely difficult&quot;.<p>The big question I have is, with all of this being said, how do I make myself seem like I&#x27;m worth giving a chance when the person making the decision is only looking 1 page of my life story for 8 seconds before putting it in the trash? I&#x27;m putting my portfolio URL below, which has links to my github and resume. If anyone has any helpful advice, I would love to hear it.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgarrettcorbin.com",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

(Apologies to John Baez)<p>A simple method for evaluating any claim about artificial intelligence or machine learning<p>1. A -5 point starting credit.
2. 1 point for every statement that is widely agreed on to be false. 
3. 2 points for every statement that is clearly vacuous. 
4. 3 points for every statement that is logically inconsistent. 
5. 5 points for each such statement that is adhered to despite careful correction. 
6. 5 points for each use of the terms “AGI”, “singularity”, “superintelligence”, “intelligence explosion” etc. as if they refer to specific future events.
7. 5 points each time a claim is justified largely by appeal to popular media examples (eg “a Terminator-like scenario”).
8. 10 points for each mention of &quot;Bostrom&quot;, &quot;Yudkowsky&quot;, “Musk”, or any person associated with the “Intellectual Dark Web”. 
9. 10 points for each mention of Roko’s Basilisk or Paperclip Maximizers.
10. 10 points for each mention of The Chinese Room argument.
11. 10 points for each mention of The Simulation Hypothesis or the “multiverse” 
12. 10 points for each use of the phrase “taking over the world”.
13. 20 points for each insistence that preventing eschatological (“end of the world”) scenarios should take precedence over all other practical and ethical concerns.
14. 30 points for treating any discussion of ethical and regulatory oversight, as is common practice across industries, as a nightmare scenario of government overreach and stifled innovation. (10 more points for comparing such oversight to Nazis, stormtroopers, or brownshirts). 
15. 40 points for anyone using or suggesting the use of AI to classify and&#x2F;or rank people by intelligence, race, sex, gender, beauty, or other social categories (eg, “criminality”). 
16. 50 points for drawing any connection whatsoever between AI and blockchain&#x2F;cryptocurrencies",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
