I take issue with this reasoning in that firstly: it lacks a denominator, VPNs are a larger source of traffic in general, abuse should be considered as a ratio. Secondly, VPNs are a known highly NATed collection of IPs, so lots of legitimate users will be thrown under the bus in the same stroke.<p>These arguments usually fall on deaf ears with most site owners who do not care about user discrimination, and will reach for the easiest blunt tool rather than make their service more fundamentally resilient.
