35378548,Show HN: Current social media platforms are abusing us,2023-03-30T20:40:20Z,yvbbrjdr,7,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN, over the years of using the social media (Instagram, Pinterest, etc..), I’m quite weary of the trend that people tend to polish their content so well and post the perfect aspect of their lives. I feel like that I’m not one of them, and anything I post will be either not so polished to fit the “magazine” style of the community or so insignificant for anyone else to care about. Scrolling in those apps more and more and seeing more and more perfect lives, I feel like I was abused by those platforms and made me anxious about myself. I want an online space that can give my voice back, allowing me to record my real life and experiences, and engage with people without feeling like judging by the platform and others.<p>I made an attempt to solve this problem by building a new social media platform called MemoFlow (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.memoflow.com&#x2F;) that generates post feed by a recommendation system that puts content information and your interest first, rather than based on your existing social circle like what everyone else is doing. Our community is very inclusive. You can not only post about your life, but also your questions, your anxieties, and any aspects of the REAL you, and be discovered by the people who shares the same feeling as you. It’s like on Twitter, when you want to express something private, you sign up for an account that no one knows and dumps all your feelings into it. You don’t want your friends and family to discover this account, but you want people who understands you to engage with you, which you well know in advance that this isn’t going to happen, because Twitter won’t expose your tweets to anyone. But on MemoFlow, you’ll actually be discovered.<p>I’d like to invite you to test my platform and any ideas&#x2F;feedbacks are well appreciated.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
