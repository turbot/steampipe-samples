I know that CPUs nowadays are insanely fast, and I know that I&#x2F;O is usually the bottleneck, but going distributed first is just making things worse by making everything harder to reason about (now we need DNS, service discovery, some nodes that orchestrate other nodes, etc.) and since we go through the network it feels like we&#x27;re increasing the probabilty of failure even though we don&#x27;t have any single point of failure (and to solve this issue a lot of redundancy (and therefore complexity) is added).<p>So, seen from this light, isn&#x27;t it weird that it has become such a popular approach?<p>And where do programmers (I&#x27;m thinking of low level game developers, graphics programmers and high-frequency trading) learn to write deliberately performant software out of a single machine before distributing horizontally?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

- location fine-grained enough to know which borough in NYC (but finer is better of course)
- anonymized unique ID
- timestamp to within an hour (but finer grained is better). Ideally, SUM the number of pings for the timerange.
