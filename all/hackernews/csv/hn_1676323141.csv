34780488,Ask HN: Good reads for Enterprise End-to-End testing?,2023-02-13T21:06:44Z,maxfit,1,false,false,,,,,,"I have started a position in the last month where I was recruited for my knowledge in developing integrated systems in a software context. Think building lab information systems and ETL pipelines, things like that. These were mostly for small-to-medium-size companies (&lt;$10M market cap). Just to make my current skillset clear, I&#x27;ve been writing software&#x2F;scripts in these and other contexts as a main job function for about ten years.<p>My current employer has identified a need to have end-to-end testing implemented to bridge development efforts across various parts of the company. This is a company for which software has traditionally been a means to an end, but is now becoming a much more-critical part of overall revenue. This is a large company (on the order of 1,000 employees).<p>Put another way, there are development teams for various major components, and these teams do not currently communicate effectively. Team B might use Team A&#x27;s product, but problems with Team A&#x27;s work currently manifest late in Team B&#x27;s development process, causing delays and issues post-release.<p>It is looking like I&#x27;m being selected as one of those to lead the effort to remedy this issue. At the executive level, the consensus is a need for end-to-end testing, and I think that&#x27;s reasonable, though there may be other facets to an effective approach. I&#x27;d like to get an idea for how these issues are currently handled. Does anyone have recommendations for reading to supplement my research? Thanks in advance!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
