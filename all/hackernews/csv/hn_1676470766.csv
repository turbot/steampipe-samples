34803689,Show HN: Rust+Svelte=Terminal,2023-02-15T13:46:14Z,iondodon,2,false,false,,,,,,"Link to project:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iondodon&#x2F;manter<p>Demo:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZjAXMMMoKGg<p>This project aims to create a terminal with functionalities that improve the experience of using terminals. Examples of useful functionalities would be autocomplete suggestion, showing the current branch of a project, prepared scripts that can be reused, and others. You can come up with your ideas. The project uses technologies such as Svelte on the front-end, which offers flexibility regarding the implementation of the interface. On the back-end side, the most important part is the PTY. All the back end is implemented in Rust. The basic framework of the project is Tauri.<p>At the moment the terminal has suggestions only for some commands (cd, ls). To support more commands it is needed to add them in the Manter&#x27;s &quot;library&quot; located at src&#x2F;cli&#x2F;library&#x2F;library.ts. It is possible to have custom script based suggestions. For example if we write in the terminal “git checkout” and after we press Space, a dropdown will appear with all available branches.<p>A good analogy to understand the purpose of this project is the following - traditional terminals are like simple code editors while this terminal is like an IDE.<p>Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project with and ideas. Imagine the terminal you would like to use. Feel free to open any issue with suggestions and bugs.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
