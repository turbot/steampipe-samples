It allows you to create synchronized filesystem caches inside the Docker Desktop VM that can automatically replace bind mounts. This gives you ext4 filesystem performance inside the Docker Desktop VM, with low-latency synchronization to-and-from the host filesystem.<p>Docker themselves actually shipped this functionality in Docker Desktop back in 2020, but they decided to pivot back to virtual filesystems with gRPC FUSE and Virtiofs. While these work fairly well, there are still substantial gains to be had for workflows that are readdir(), stat(), read(), and write()-heavy. This includes things like package installs (e.g. npm and Composer), dynamic language runtimes (e.g. PHP or Node.js), and compiling code.<p>This new implementation is significantly more performant[1], offers a more detailed UI, and gives you the option of setting the user and group IDs for files sync&#x27;d into the VM. You can even create multiple caches of the same files with different UIDs&#x2F;GIDs, allowing containers with different UIDs&#x2F;GIDs to access the same files without permissions conflicts.<p>This extension is closed-source and requires a subscription for some functionality, but that money helps to support the corresponding open-source project.<p>I&#x27;d be keen to hear your feedback. There are a few minor limitations (mostly SDK limitations), but nothing too significant. The next step is probably going to be adding support for remote Docker engines, but I&#x27;d be interested to know if there are other pressing features that people would like to see.<p>Disclaimer: I am a Docker Captain, though this tool is not developed, sponsored, or endorsed by Docker, Inc.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mutagen-io&#x2F;mutagen"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mutagen-io&#x2F;mutagen</a><p>[1]: The Docker Desktop EULA prevents me from publishing benchmarks, but the performance difference will be the same as the difference between gRPC FUSE or Virtiofs and a &quot;native&quot; ext4 volume inside the VM. This will differ between hardware and virtualization frameworks. The best option is testing your own workflow.",story,https://mutagen.io/documentation/docker-desktop-extension,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Which will not filter based on prime. It easy to turn on and I do. But if you change your search query it&#x27;s turn off again. If I am a Prime member why wouldn&#x27;t I WANT to see prime first always. It appears Amazon does not want me to purchase prime items.<p>The above coupled with the fact that all shipping is 7+ days out when this time last year I was able to still get 2 day delivery. I live within 10 miles of a major distribution center yet it takes a week to get a package?<p>Anyways, might be the last on to cancel my prime in HN.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This is the reason why having an integrated UI improves the workflows by 50% (22s vs 54s). You can check out the video we have about a simple workflow.<p>How much optimization?<p>We have 10 years experience with various clients in this space and based on the previous experiences the optimization potential is between 10 - 30% year over year infrastructure cost. This is a lot for many companies, especially nowadays.<p>Where are we with this product?<p>This is the first iteration of the product and we just got started. The next iteration is going to be metadata analytics engine for data that is stored on AWS S3. Based on the metadata we can get insight into the efficiency of the data set and provide guidance for optimizing it.<p>The second next iteration we are planning to implement a SQL parsing engine that provides automatic data lineage so that people can track how data flows through their system.<p>Detailed blog post with a lot more:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.depoxy.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022-12-07-introducing-depoxy"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.depoxy.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022-12-07-introducing-depoxy</a><p>Let us know what you think.
