34892538,Ask HN: What are your experiences/suggestions for a high-end silent setup?,2023-02-22T06:58:58Z,jhoelzel,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hello everyone,<p>I&#x27;m currently preparing a high-end, silent setup and would love to hear your advice and suggestions. I&#x27;m planning on using DDR5 7000 and an Intel i9 13900, to prep myself for the coming years. My Surface Book is a great example of a silent multi-core setup, even with a GTX 1060, so that&#x27;s the level of silence I&#x27;m aiming for. Its in the whispering noise range so about 20-30 db.<p>I&#x27;m debating with myself if liquid cooling would be the way to go, but as far as I understand Fans can be better regulated and thus more silent?<p>The room where I&#x27;ll be setting up the new build is climate-controlled, so I&#x27;m considering a larger and insulated case to help with sound dampening. 
So, I&#x27;m turning to you guys for your insights and recommendations and most of all experience.<p>What components have you found to work best for a high-end, silent setup?<p>What are some ways to optimize a build for quietness?<p>Have you build an insulation chamber and did it catch fire?<p>Any and all suggestions are appreciated.<p>Thank you in advance for your help.<p>PS: I know that the most silent option would be to put the computer into another room, but that sadly not an option as there are no adjacent rooms. I could dedicate part of the room as a &quot;serve room&quot;, but insulating that I am even more worried of suffacating the poor thing.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
