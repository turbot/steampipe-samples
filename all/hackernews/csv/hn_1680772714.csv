35466005,Show HN: Dabdab – Streaming Notes,2023-04-06T09:05:00Z,can3p,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi! I&#x27;d like a project I&#x27;ve been working on lately to make an app to record thought process the way it fits me.<p>I think current note taking solutions are a poor fit for the cases where you just want do dump your thoughts on a topic quickly or where time when a note has been taken actually matters or in cases like science where you want to keep a log of actions to be able to troubleshoot or reproduce your experiment<p>I&#x27;ve built my own thing - dabdab.org. You can think of it as a baby of twitter and google keep of sorts but without all social features of twitter.<p>The base concept is a stream of messages, streams can be nested and have additional fields defined, you can make things public if you want to, but it&#x27;s decided per stream and you can even share by link. It&#x27;s useful for all kinds of observations and data recording.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the last two months and it works great for me.<p>For example I have streams to store quotes from books with my comments on them, do a quick dump on the recipes for the dishes I&#x27;ve made, dump y thoughts on anything I&#x27;d like to build in a future or observations from my swimming sessions along with the weather and temperature. Dabdab is smart enough to render some graphs based on this data!<p>Since streams are separate, it&#x27;s possible to have different visibility settings on them, share them with different options (read-only, write-only, read-write, rss) that allows to implement different usage scenarios, messages support markdown, image uploads and youtube embeds. On the website you can check that both product blog and feedback form were implemented via streams.<p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different concepts there. For example you can generate multiple share links for the same stream which allows you to be able to stop sharing on a granular basis.<p>I have a much bigger vision for it (make it a central place to record any time related information from log messages to the data from smartwatch, use it for team collaboration like virtual standups etc) but really want to get some users before I go that far.<p>The whole thing is built with go and htmx and it was really cool experience! I&#x27;ll make a separate writeup on that some day.<p>I&#x27;ve made a couple of demo videos[0] [1], please check it out! Any feedback is welcome. The service is fully functional, registration is open if you want to give it a go<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;GJURq8PH_d4"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;GJURq8PH_d4</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;x7dCEOgzD1s"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;x7dCEOgzD1s</a>",story,https://dabdab.org/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
