I just want to get off my chest my thoughts that the fact that a $2 trillion company is programming a robot using plain English is the most scifi thing ever. It seems straight out of Asimov. If you had asked me a few years ago, I would have said it&#x27;s completely unrealistic. That&#x27;s not how computers work, I would have said. They follow rigorous logical mathematical operations and machine instructions based on boolean logic. You can&#x27;t just tell it what you want it to do in English and then put it in front of the public, and if you could the public couldn&#x27;t get it to do something different just by asking in plain English.
I&#x27;m sure the feeling will wear off, but as someone who uses it daily, I still sometimes get the feeling that AI is like science fiction.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
