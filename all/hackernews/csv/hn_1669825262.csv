Although I am very certain of what&#x27;s below, I would highly suggest you were to go ahead with independent enquiries to validate my findings -- Findings which are extremely worrying.<p>The script being loaded is named &quot;moatframe.js&quot;, this file is loaded from the following URL; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;z.moatads.com&#x2F;addthismoatframe568911941483&#x2F;moatframe.js.
There are conflicting results after searching this particular filename, but as mentioned I have de-obfuscating the code.<p>Side note: After navigating to moatads.com, there was previously an A record, which would return to a redirect to a large networking company (which to the best of my knowledge was CISCO).
However, there is a possibility that an individual thread actor would be able to hide behind the name of a company as large as CISCO.<p>After decompiling the script, we found that the code calls a system API call to a function named &quot;MSFAPI&quot;. This script is in essence calling the Metasploit Framework API.<p>This particular framework allows a remote javascript shell to be created, which wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if it weren&#x27;t for a venerability it can potentially target on Edge products running on Microsoft.<p>With this particular framework we were able to find a gitlab server that seems highly related containing code that can essentially open a local shell on Microsoft Windows 10. This exploit originally targeted routers, but is no longer online, the code was previously hosted at the domain http:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.hunter-ht.cn&#x2F;.<p>This alone would allow for local files to be pulled from the server and modified. Along with a privilege escalation attack, a key logger, RAT or something similar may be installed on the chosen computer merely by accessing the webpage.<p>As mentioned, please double check my findings, as someone who uses the internet I strongly hope I am wrong.<p>Please let me know your own findings.<p>Owen.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The classic example from cryptography is the millionaires&#x27; problem, where two millionaires compute who is richer without revealing their wealth to each other.<p>MPC has in the past been mostly confined to academia, but thanks to some recent papers has finally become fast enough for practical applications. Tandem uses Garbled Circuits, encrypted circuits consisting of boolean gates. While there have been other implementations based on these ideas, Tandem tries to provide a much better user experience than previous attempts. For example, the Tandem repo includes a server, a command line client and client libs for wasm and native architectures. To make it easier to run practical applications, programs can be written in Garble, a custom Rust-like programming language that compiles to Garbled Circuits.<p>(The most practical application to date using Tandem is &quot;Encryptle&quot;, a Wordle clone that runs entirely over MPC. Depending on latency, a client&#x2F;server exchange takes about 400ms, which makes the UX very similar to the real Wordle, with the twist that the server cannot see the guess in plain text and the browser cannot see the solution in plain text. Instead, guess and solution are kept private and compared using MPC.)",story,https://github.com/sine-fdn/tandem,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
