I&#x27;ve already received valuable feedback from 10 users within my close network (running my tool in production :) ), but I&#x27;m hoping to expand that to ideally 100 users or ultimately 1000 users to gain more diverse insights, needs, and recommendations.<p>So, I&#x27;m reaching out to the Growth Hacking community to help me achieve that goal. If you have experience in driving growth for early-stage startups, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on how I can attract more testers and early adopters.<p>Ultimately, I&#x27;m looking to create a tool that saves time and makes life easier for developers and DevOps teams. Your feedback and advice are invaluable in helping me achieve that goal.<p>To make it easy for testers to get started with LogsHQ, I&#x27;m offering a Free Plan that includes all the features. For testers who would like to commit to using LogsHQ in the future, I&#x27;m also offering a coupon for 40% off the subscription price for the first year.

34873156,Ask HN: Thoughts on this post about HAARP/EQs/Aurora/Balloons,2023-02-20T21:27:20Z,samstave,1,false,false,,,,,,"HAARP [0] was built in 1993, and its often been accused of being able to incite tectonic response from the Earth. Obviously, this is the tinfoil... but for a couple decades HAARP has been blamed for earthquakes.<p>What I find interesting in this, is that with the &quot;spy balloons&quot;, aside from the one which was shot down over the Atlantic, after &#x27;passing through&#x27; Alaska and then across the US is supposedly &quot;Chinese&quot;...<p>The other balloons were shot down over Alaska, and over Billings.<p>Interestingly, both HAARP and the other balloons for weather tracking are from University Fairbanks. (and there has been a lot of posts recently for the strength of the Aurora - such as the super bright one yesterday from Alaska which made the entire night and snow glow strong green color)<p>Video from GeoEngineering: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QBt9rqXkcXo<p>-<p>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity.&quot;</i><p>--<p>Now for the core of the conspiracy ; If HAARP can cause earthquakes through the interactions between the Ionosphere, or the beam pointing from bouncing waves off the Ionosphere, it would be interesting if that activity was being measured&#x2F;tracked through the balloons that they use to measure aspects of the Ionosphere, and the blowing up of the balloons was to destroy the evidence of tracking and monitoring the effects of 3.6 Million Watt beams being shot up from multiple locations, and converging on the same point. Its interesting that we have Earthquake Lights - where the atmosphere above a major earthquake will light up the sky just prior to the EQ, kind of like sheet lightning, due to the changes in ionization. (and recall, there are treaties that were signed (supposedly) decades ago banning weather-warfare...<p>There was a 6.4 again in Turkey today, more building collapsed, but were apparently building that were already damaged in the previous.<p>So if we could look into the correlation between very strong Aurora, EQs, and when&#x2F;if one of the HAARP installations was active at the time... (look at the wiki for the image of the activity bands:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;D7xqMHK.png<p>Notice that &quot;high activity&quot; is the RED band, which is closest to Turkey&#x27;s region... and then look at this path of the chinese balloon, which roughly follows the path of the bands in the Aurora output:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;DocezpQ.png<p>---<p>There are also patents related to using HAARP to send ULF both into the atmosphere and into the ground... (see patents below)<p>So, I find it interesting to correlation (not causation) for massive geological event (a 1 in 1,000 year series of earthquakes in Turkey - in a swarm where typically each of the earthquakes by themselves would still be considered massive, and more than 60,000 people have died so far (the current official number claimed by MSM is 45,000 - but there are thousands who were recovered and buried without being added to the tally, as well as thousands of bodies that were pulverized and wont be discovered for a time, if at all)<p>I am not saying this is how it is, I am just saying I find all these coincidences <i>odd</i>...<p>Obviously turkey is basically bordered by tectonic boundaries ; the timing of everything is bizarre.<p>--<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;HAARP<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US8299936B2&#x2F;en?q=(HAARP)&amp;oq=HAARP<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US8115622B2&#x2F;en?q=(HAARP)&amp;oq=HAARP",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
