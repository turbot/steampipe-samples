I assumed this was the most  robust use of my limited energy because these skills could be used in almost any white collar position which uses computers to perform repetitive tasks or intersects with structured and unstructured data.<p>At least, that was the idea x years ago. Now it seems we&#x27;re on the verge of a centralizing and commoditizing revolution in ML and UX where entire swaths of knowledge producer skills will become obsolete.<p>Where will that leave people trying for either ML engineer or more data analysis focused DS roles?  Or even just everyday utility scripting&#x2F;automating powers?  Can even the latter two can be largely replaced by hybrid finetuned multi modal language&#x2F;code models.
