I handled it well and of course at the time both myself and my doctor treated it as the flu after I assured her I had not recently visited China.<p>It seems like since that period in time, my physical and mental abilities have very slightly deteriorated. I used to wake up early, hit the gym for a solid 90 minutes, meal prep and eat healthy, diligently work on my side projects and generally be “on the ball”.<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint when, but it seems like since the infection I feel generally weaker, have trouble being decisive, ambition seems diminished, general “clarity” seems to be gone.<p>It’s difficult to say whether this was caused by the infection or caused by the pandemic and socioeconomic changes that followed, or something else. I never got the Covid vaccine but I’ve heard it might help with “long Covid”, so I’m just curious if anyone else suffered similar symptoms and ended up curing them.<p>Again, I know HN is not a medical forum but I do not know of another forum for an intellectual discussion on this topic.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
