34673963,An Overview of the Current State of AI Dubbing Technology,2023-02-06T06:08:10Z,wavelai,1,false,false,,,,,,"The field of AI dubbing technology has come a long way in recent years, offering new and innovative solutions for synchronizing speech in various languages. Today, organizations and individuals alike are taking advantage of AI-powered voiceover solutions to streamline the dubbing process and achieve high-quality results.<p>With the rapid advancement of machine learning algorithms, AI dubbing technology is now able to learn from large amounts of data and accurately mimic human speech patterns, resulting in more natural-sounding audio. This technology is also capable of adapting to different accents, inflections, and speech rates, making it an ideal solution for a variety of applications.<p>Intelligent audio substitution is a crucial component of AI dubbing technology. It allows for real-time speech synchronization, ensuring that the dubbed audio is perfectly in sync with the original video or audio content. This technology is particularly useful in the entertainment industry, where time and budget constraints often make traditional dubbing methods challenging to implement.<p>The next-generation language dubbing technology is not only cost-effective, but it is also much faster than traditional methods, allowing organizations to quickly and efficiently localize their content for a global audience. With its ability to adapt to different languages and accents, it opens up new opportunities for businesses to reach a wider audience and expand their reach.<p>In conclusion, the current state of AI dubbing technology is exciting and promising, offering advanced solutions for speech synchronization, audio substitution, and more. As the technology continues to evolve, it will play an increasingly important role in the entertainment industry, as well as many other industries that rely on the accurate and natural-sounding transmission of speech.<p>For More details read more here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wavel.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an-overview-of-the-current-state-of-ai-dubbing-technology-and-how-it-is-being-used-in-the-media-industry&#x2F;",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I live in a small room at my university. I am planning on training bodyweight or calisthenics as it is called popularly.<p>HNers who train from home using minimal weights or equipments, can you suggest a path for me.<p>I am looking for some hints on:<p>1. What is the bare minimum balanced routine I can start with?<p>2. How long should I stick to it before I see or feel actual results from it?<p>3. Diet? Eggs are easily available for me.<p>4. A bit about your journey. How you started and how have you progressed on parameters of strength, routine, size, energy, etc.<p>P.S: I came across this youtube channel: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Kboges where he suggests that to gain strength and general fitness you can train daily with 3 movements but not to failure. Is it possible?<p>My goals are to have enough muscle and strength so that I don&#x27;t get tired doing chores lifting something for my household. I want this to go far into my old age so that I don&#x27;t fall and spend my final years in a nursing home bed.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34673949,Did anyone else lose their marbles?,2023-02-06T06:06:41Z,throoowwawaayy,2,false,false,,,,,,"Typical story I imagine-- ambitious, smart, promising career, was a technical co-founder at a small startup, and things seemed fine. Then I found myself wandering in the woods all day, crying for no reason and looking for non-existent fossils, which I found. I eventually saw petrified sea creatures everywhere and stopped going to work, or answering my phone, paying bills, etc. Things ended predictably, in horrible slow motion. Now I have a two year hole in my life, and I’ll never forgive myself for what I put my family through.<p>But nobody else will ever know that.
I’m functional and back in the industry, but it’s not the sort of thing people discuss at the water cooler.<p>So I’d like to ask if anyone else had a secret breakdown? I’m curious if my story is an outlier, or if this is one of those things that “just happens” to some people.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
