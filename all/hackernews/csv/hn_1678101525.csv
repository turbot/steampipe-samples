They are cool and very easy to use. I like them. Some other SaaS, like Linear, Netlify etc., seem to have one.<p>I was thinking having one such command bar for SaaS may be helpful. A few open-source projects are available but need heavy customisation to make them work - UI, integrating support, etc.<p>If you tried implementing one, what was your experience? Any positive outcomes?<p>Others - What is your take on it? Do you think it will make your experience better?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This is an online store engine project made in PHP and JS. We also used Bootstrap 5. I would like to describe everything in detail, but it seems to me that on the project page it will be more convenient to get acquainted with the project itself and its capabilities. I hope that our project can be useful to many developers.
