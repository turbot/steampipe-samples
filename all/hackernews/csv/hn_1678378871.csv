I&#x27;ve been working on a small project called DemandHunt.<p>Basically I aggregated problems in niche communities so that you as an entrepreneur can take inspiration.<p>The background is that I&#x27;ve worked with a number of startups and I&#x27;ve found that many entrepreneurs already have a technology or solution in mind and work backwards to find the people with the problems to solve. This is YC&#x27;s &quot;Solution in Search of a Problem&quot; problem, and my understanding is that it&#x27;s typically better to work the other way around so you can build the right solution for the problem you find instead.<p>Thus I figured maybe some hacker types like me would appreciate reading about problems in their interest areas so that they can get the ball rolling from the right direction. I went and did some reading in some niche Reddit communities and manually aggregated the user posts into tangible problems that might inspire you.<p>I&#x27;m curious to see if this is interesting or useful to anyone here!<p>Let me know what you think, if you want me to target your interests, or updates, or anything :)",story,https://www.demandhunt.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35082508,Show HN: Safe Data Changes in PostgreSQL,2023-03-09T15:51:03Z,ciminelli,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN, we&#x27;re excited to share our open source tool with the community! We previously posted[0] here with the tagline “real-time events for Postgres”. But after feedback from early users and the community, we’ve shifted our focus to working on tooling for manual database changes.<p>We&#x27;ve consistently heard teams describe challenges with the way manual data updates are handled. Seemingly every engineer we spoke with had examples of errant queries that ended up causing significant harm in production environments (data loss&#x2F;service interruptions).<p>We’ve seen a few different approaches to how changes to production databases occur today:<p>Option 1: all engineers have production write access (highest speed, highest risk)
Option 2: one or a few engineers have write access (medium speed, high risk)
Option 3: engineers request temporary access to make changes (low speed, medium risk)
Option 4: all updates are checked into version control and run manually or through CI&#x2F;CD (low speed, low risk)
Option 5: no manual updates are made - all changes must go through an internal endpoint (lowest speed, lowest risk)<p>Our goal is to enable high speed changes with the lowest risk possible. We’re planning to do this by providing an open-source toolkit for safeguarding databases, including the following features:<p>- Alerts (available now): Receive notifications any time a manual change occurs
- Audit History (beta): View all historical manual changes with context
- Query Preview (coming soon): Preview affected rows and query plan prior to running changes
- Approval Flow (coming soon): Require query review before a change can be run<p>We’re starting with alerts. Teams can receive Slack notifications anytime an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE is executed from a non-application database user. While this doesn’t prevent issues from occurring, it does enable an initial level of traceability and understanding who made an update, what data was changed, and when it occurred.<p>We’d love to hear feedback from the HN community on how you’ve seen database changes handled, pain points you’ve experienced with data change processes, or generally any feedback on our thinking and approach.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34828169"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34828169</a>",story,https://github.com/inqueryio/inquery,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Using Livecycle, developers get clear feedback earlier in the release cycle leading to higher-quality products, a faster release cadence, and fewer context switches and misunderstandings.<p>Livecycle builds and pushes a dev-like environment for every branch in your repo (or, if you prefer, you can bring your own environments). Any containerized application will work, and support for multiple containers via docker-compose is coming soon. You get a unique, shareable link for every branch, which automatically updates for every commit pushed to that branch.<p>Each link contains not only your deployed environment but also includes:<p>- A dashboard to view and manage all of your environments and users<p>- Collaboration features - create screenshots, record audio&#x2F;video clips, suggest CSS&#x2F;content changes, and leave comments with rich text and internal threads<p>- Integration with Jira&#x2F;Linear (view tickets associated with a PR or create new tickets from comments users left on the environment)<p>- Integration with GitHub&#x2F;GitLab - view your build status in the PR&#x2F;MR (with a link to the environment), comments left on Livecycle will be synced to PR&#x2F;MR comments so that devs can easily gather feedback from both devs and other stakeholders in one place<p>- Even more stuff: Slack integration, integrated network, and console logs, etc…<p>We’re thrilled to see a wide variety of teams already benefitting from Livecycle - large companies, startups, freelance developers, dev shops, and more.<p>And we invite you to check out how Livecycle can bring value to you and your team.<p>And please let us know if you have any comments or questions :-)",story,https://livecycle.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
