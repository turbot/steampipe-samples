I already have a buyer who is an accredited investor willing to purchase, and I&#x27;ve read the paperwork to know that this is allowed by my company&#x27;s stock plan (the only thing the company has is the right to buy shares I want to sell at a higher price than my buyer).<p>Equity Zen and Forge Global are often recommended, but are unwilling to help in this case (they are insisting that we go through their secondary market and can&#x27;t guarantee that I will sell to my specific buyer, they want to get a larger cut of the transaction, etc.). They are also saying that they need my company&#x27;s CEO&#x27;s permission as well, which I know isn&#x27;t true (based on speaking to past employees).<p>I&#x27;m guessing this isn&#x27;t a commonly advertised service, but there are probably lawyers who are capable of doing this.
