As part of my undergrad NLP thesis, I trained a Markov Chain on 100,000+ company names, stored it in S3, and hosted a Flask API endpoint on EC2. It was decent, but nowhere near the level of quality I wanted it to be.<p>Now that OpenAI&#x27;s APIs are available to use, I decided to give this another shot!
