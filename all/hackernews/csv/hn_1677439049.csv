34947945,Ask HN: Do recruiters purposefully ignore you after a rejection?,2023-02-26T18:27:39Z,throwaway8365,2,false,false,4,[34948013],,,,"There are valid reasons to want to talk to the recruiter after a rejection. For example, you might not have passed the bar for a certain seniority level, but might be willing to re-apply for a lower level. Or you might want to ask the cool-off period they expect before attempting to apply again.<p>I&#x27;ve had a couple of rejections now and asked just those things, but got crickets in response.<p>The naive in me thinks that &quot;recruiters probably have massive inboxes clogged with inbound applicants and didn&#x27;t see your message&quot;. 
The cynic&#x2F;tinfoil thinks &quot;there&#x27;s probably a &#x27;reject&#x27; button that once pressed sends the canned &#x27;thank you for your time&#x27; email while setting up an email filter to send your messages straight to the spam folder&quot;.<p>I guess reality must be somehwere in between. What are your thoughts? Is there any industry standard in this, or is it really up to different recruiters in different companies at different times do different things?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It&#x27;s been challenging to do this at work, so I&#x27;ve been exploring ideas for creating a useful app that will also allow me to use a cool tech-stack and recent AI progress.<p>I have spoken to many couples and therapists, and a common theme that came up was communication problems. I dug a bit deeper and realized that these issues could be prevented, if people consciously get to know each other at the initial dating stage.<p>So I have created an app that helps couples establish meaningful communication from the early stages of their relationship. The app gives you a question and an action for your date, then afterwards app sends you a self-reflection question and ask for your feedback on how it went. App also provides an entertaining way to keep a relationship diary.

So, I have introduced AI-generated questions based on the detailed feedback on how conversations went, their relationship diary within the app, previous questions, relationship goal, their milestones and level of intimacy. With all this context, GPT-3 can create a personalized question about the specific issue you&#x27;re facing.<p>I want to make the personalization even more precise and require less input from you (because let&#x27;s be real, not everybody wants to write long diaries).<p>What do you think are the best ways to achieve it? I am thinking about fine-tuning the model on our examples how to ask a personalised question with a given context of smaller size.",story,https://nemlys.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
