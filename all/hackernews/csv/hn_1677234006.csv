I&#x27;m trying to be good at it. Yes, I want to earn money with it, however, I want to make something decent. That&#x27;s when perfectionism takes place.<p>And it&#x27;s unbearable, endless vicious circle. I just keep thinking: hey, how about making a cool catalogue of UI&#x2F;UX tips? Or maybe make a PDF?

34922979,Ask HN: How to prevent a company from taking my domain name?,2023-02-24T10:13:52Z,lname_dot_com,2,false,false,,,,,,"I have bought a 5 letter COM domain name that I&#x27;ll call lname.com, which matches my last name. It has no meaning in English. I&#x27;m from a poor country and I spent like a year or so to save up for it, which cost roughly 6 months of average net salaries in my country about 7 years ago.<p>I was in my early 20s and one could argue, that it was not the wisest decion of a young adult, but I don&#x27;t regret it honestly. It always felt like I have a small piece of the web realestate which has my name labeled on it and I absolutely love my fname@lname.com email address. I created an address for my wife, father, mother, brother and his wife in the same way which they are using daily and are proud of.<p>I was very stressed for any domain or registrar errors that might cause that I lose the domain name and I still am very afraid of it. I have however read quite a few &quot;horror stories&quot; in the past years, regarding bigger companies which were able to obtain people&#x27;s personal or business domain names, just because they are huge companies with extensive finances and good lawyers. I already know of two companies in different countries which have the very same name as I occasionally receive emails written to them on my catch-all email address.<p>For now the domain is used to host our personal sites, but I recently started working as a web developer and may do freelance work or even create a startup or company in the future. I don&#x27;t know what this domain will be used for, but I can&#x27;t say that it will always be for personal use. Maybe it will be the same industry as other companies with the same name. Maybe not. I know a domain name can&#x27;t be patented. Trademarking is possible, but there are a lot of requirements. What do experts propose?<p>TLDR: What can I do to secure my domain name, no matter what happens?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
