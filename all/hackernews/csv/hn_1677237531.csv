The simulator allows users to manipulate the cube using keyboard inputs, just like a real Rubik&#x27;s Cube.<p>I built this project for fun and to improve my OpenGL skills. However, I would appreciate any feedback or tips from the community on how to improve the project further. I am open to suggestions on new features or better coding practices.<p>To get started with the project, you will need to have G++ compiler, GLUT library, OpenGL library, and GLU library installed on your local machine. Once you have these prerequisites installed, simply clone the repository onto your local machine, navigate to the project directory, and compile the code using the &quot;make all&quot; command.<p>You can run the program using the &quot;.&#x2F;bin&#x2F;Debug&quot; command, and then start manipulating the Rubik&#x27;s Cube using the keyboard and mouse controls listed in the README file.<p>If you are interested in contributing to the project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. I welcome all contributions and feedback.<p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on CubeSolver.<p>Best regards,<p>Vinícius",story,https://github.com/abstratovcm/CubeSolver,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34923080,Tell HN: Google suspended my Gmail account for no reason,2023-02-24T10:30:04Z,zachrip,3,false,false,,,,,,"A few months ago I tried to sign up for a developer account with Apple with my .nl email address (let&#x27;s call it zach@biz.nl for this post). For whatever reason, Apple wouldn&#x27;t let me use that email - while frustrating, I was able to get around this by creating a gmail account for my business (let&#x27;s call it biznl@gmail.com for this post).<p>Fast forward to last week, I try to log in to the gmail account and I&#x27;m met with a message like &quot;your account has been disabled because you violated terms of service.&quot; Odd, I think - I haven&#x27;t done anything weird with this account, all I used it for was the Apple developer account.<p>So I appealed the decision - the form asks me to explain how I was using my account and more or less asks me to defend my actions. Except the message doesn&#x27;t tell you which rule you broke. So I explained how I was using the account and submitted. I think to myself &quot;I probably just got caught in some filter, a human can fix this for me.&quot;<p>Wrong. A few days pass and I get an email from them - my request has been declined and there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it - it&#x27;s from a noreply address. They offered me a takeout download of the email and I downloaded it to see if maybe I had been hacked or something - the list of emails in the mbox are as follows:<p>- Your Google Account is live – now help your business grow<p>- Verify your Apple ID email address.<p>- Uw bestelling wordt verwerkt ***<p>- Welcome to the Apple Developer Program.<p>- Welcome to App Store Connect.<p>- Uw Apple factuur nummer **<p>- Update to taxes on Apple Books sales in British Columbia.<p>- Correct your banking details to receive payments.<p>- Upcoming tax and price changes for apps and in-app purchases<p>- Upcoming currency change in Croatia<p>- Upcoming price and tax changes for apps and in-app purchases<p>Clearly I&#x27;m abusing the system.<p>So now my business Apple developer account is locked up in an email that I lost access to for no reason.<p>Some notes:
- I have my biz email: zach@biz.nl - I pay for gsuite on this address<p>- I created biznl@gmail.com so I could sign up for Apple dev<p>- I have only sent one email from the gmail, it was a test email to zach@biz.nl just to make sure I had setup mx records correctly<p>If anyone knows a way I can escalate this or something I would greatly appreciate it.<p>I&#x27;m also working on the Apple side to try and change my email to my real email so I can dump the gmail account. If anyone can help me with this I would be very grateful, I&#x27;ve requested a change but I&#x27;m worried they won&#x27;t allow it since I don&#x27;t have access to the original email.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
