It&#x27;s an additional crate (ractor_cluster) that builds on ractor to facilitate the inter-connection between nodes and support remote casts and calls to actors on a remote node.<p>We&#x27;re openly seeking feedback, so please feel free to utilize the library and let us know if there&#x27;s anything you find missing or doesn&#x27;t work as expected!",story,https://github.com/slawlor/ractor,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
