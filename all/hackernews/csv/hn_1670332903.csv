yesterday, I stumbled over an old project of mine called Click The Number. It&#x27;s a game I built six years ago to compare my speed and dexterity with that of my friends. You have to click the numbers in ascending order – as quickly as possible!<p>After the discovery, I couldn&#x27;t resist and continued working on this project for a bit. I made the colors a bit nicer, update some of the code, and added a high score to make the game slightly more addictive. I now have more ideas than time to build them.<p>A friend of mine gave this game to their kids (who love it!) and recommended I should build an actual mobile game out of this.  I replied that it is really hard to get a game like that off the ground, especially when there is no real &quot;progress&quot; you can make. What do you think about pursuing this? Are there variations of this theme that could make it work?<p>If you&#x27;re interested, share your record on the leaderboard in the project&#x27;s Readme [1]. I trust you to only add real scores ;)<p>Have a great day
– Marc<p>PS: Being fast on desktop is a different skill than being fast on mobile.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;remarcable&#x2F;ClickTheNumber"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;remarcable&#x2F;ClickTheNumber</a>",story,https://projects.marcnitzsche.de/ClickTheNumber/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
