34930635,Show HN: Discord Wordle Result Bot,2023-02-24T21:52:49Z,ramity,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN! I created a self-hostable discord bot for scraping and calculating wordle result statistics[0]. The deployment process makes use of docker, and the setup process is thoroughly described in the readme[1].<p>A group of my friends and I post our wordle results into a channel on our discord, and we&#x27;ve deliberated in the past who has the best score, opener, etc. I used this project as an excuse to explore the discord.py package[2]. It skips non-wordle related messages and uses some checks to determine if the message is a share result, if it&#x27;s a malformed result, etc. The project only currently leverages the discord.py package for scraping messages from a configured channel, but I have intentions of making it command accessible and possibly a public bot if there&#x27;s enough interest.<p>So far, it currently calculates:<p>- Count<p>- Score (average number of guesses across all samples)<p>- Off by 1 count (Number of times the second to last guess is off by 1)<p>- Average % across each guess tier (1,2,3,4,5,6,X)<p>- Average value by each guess tier<p>- X-less streak (breaks on x result)<p>- Post streak (breaks on missing a wordle post)<p>- Combined streak (what the wordle website uses (x-less and post))<p>- Graphs of guess results per user<p>Check the readme for example outputs to see some stat breakdowns[3].<p>Let me know your thoughts! I&#x27;d love to hear any suggestions for future updates or improvements.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ramity&#x2F;discord-wordle-processor"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ramity&#x2F;discord-wordle-processor</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ramity&#x2F;discord-wordle-processor#requirements"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ramity&#x2F;discord-wordle-processor#requireme...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discordpy.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discordpy.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;intro.html</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ramity&#x2F;discord-wordle-processor#example-outputs"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ramity&#x2F;discord-wordle-processor#example-o...</a>",story,https://github.com/ramity/discord-wordle-processor,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
