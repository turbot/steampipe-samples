35415064,Show HN: Spine – Create and Share ChatGPT-like Interfaces on multi-modal data,2023-04-02T20:51:30Z,akshaybudhkar,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN Community!<p>We&#x27;re excited to introduce Spine, a tool we&#x27;ve been developing for the past month that aims to streamline the process of building and sharing AI-driven natural language interfaces like ChatGPT for various data formats.<p>With Spine, you can:
* Upload numerous data types such as websites, PDFs, docs, PowerPoints, CSVs, audio files, YouTube videos, and more<p>* Navigate lots of data and get in-depth referenced results with our hybrid search<p>* Built-in Feedback: Craft accurate, personalized &amp; adaptive experiences -- we will update the search models and eventually your LLM with the feedback<p>* Easy sharing: Seamlessly share your Spines so anyone can interact with your data (currently, you can share them on our website)<p>Spine is currently powered by a few open-source libraries (HF, llama-index, etc.) along with OpenAI. We have designed Spine so that it should be simple to make it LLM-agnostic; we should be able to swap out GPT-3 (the default behaviour right now) for Cohere or an open-source LLM like FLAN or Bloom. We also want to make it trivial to embed Spine in any form -- and are currently working on making an API available so users can embed us on their website or slack. We also have a few known issues we are navigating through: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharing.clickup.com&#x2F;9003104561&#x2F;l&#x2F;h&#x2F;6-900301350489-1&#x2F;07fb4c3215c0209"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharing.clickup.com&#x2F;9003104561&#x2F;l&#x2F;h&#x2F;6-900301350489-1&#x2F;...</a>.<p>A bit about us: we&#x27;re Akshay and Ashwin, two passionate tech folks with backgrounds in AI, ML, and startups. Akshay is an AI lead at Georgian, where he helps growth-stage companies build ML products and has previously worked at two YC companies. Ashwin is a senior engineer at Instacart with previous experience at Alexa &amp; Aurora (AWS) and NVIDIA. We studied ML together at the University of Waterloo and Nanyang Technological University on an exchange program some years ago.<p>We created Spine in response to the growing demand for incorporating LLM-based chat interfaces into products and services in our companies. Our goal is to make this process as easy and accessible as possible.<p>We&#x27;re still in beta and eager to listen and gather your feedback. To facilitate this, we&#x27;ve prepared three demos that can be accessed without signing up (search through guides for hiring or getting hired remotely, some material from the All-in crew, and a demo on education highlighting some multi-modality). We also have a couple of loom videos if you want to see Spine in Action on the landing page!<p>If you sign up (fingers crossed, everything runs smoothly), you can upload, create, and share as many Spines as you&#x27;d like for free!<p>Please share any feedback or suggestions you may have. We&#x27;re all ears!",story,https://www.getspine.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
