I work on a software product in a niche, within a niche, within a niche, to help a subset of large corporations process data a little bit more effectively during meetings.<p>My compensation is beyond what I ever imagined making 10 years ago. I work remotely, my job is not demanding, I have time during my day to do other things. Stress is also low.<p>I just feel like it&#x27;s kind of a waste of my existence though. I can contribute to things, I can help society, etc - but I kind of feel like I have these golden handcuffs. Why leave when my situation is so good, despite doing basically nothing useful?<p>Recently listened to this podcast called &quot;13 minutes to the moon&quot;. A really interesting dive in to the lives and efforts of the engineers that made the Apollo missions possible. They really did something with their engineering skills. Programmers were a huge part in the mission success.<p>I however, don&#x27;t really feel like the mission I&#x27;m helping currently is meaningful. And it seems like most programming jobs are the same.<p>Not really sure what I&#x27;m asking. I guess a simple TLDR would be -<p>Are there any coding jobs with actual meaning out there? Is it possible to take those on without sacrificing my income to &lt;200k?<p>I had a large interest in aerospace contracting. It just seems like the paycut will be &gt;50%, and I will not be able to work remotely anymore.<p>&#x2F;endrant",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
