So we thought there could be an opportunity to improve this type of work &amp; make it less painful, automate more &amp; provide high value, so, today I&#x27;m proud to present you:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getstage.app – Stage is an API based developer portfolio, bring your data from sources like GitHub, LinkedIn, Spotify &amp; more, ootb gorgeous design &amp; be always in-sync. You can even create custom extensions w&#x2F; code.<p>With the layoffs crushing our industry atm, it&#x27;s the first time in like a decade were it&#x27;s even more important to have a good presentation online if you&#x27;re affected. With our approach of fetching data from other sources, you don&#x27;t go to update-hell. Just use the platforms &amp; services you are anyway using.<p>What will it cost you ask? Creating a portfolio will be free, forever. We currently thinking about adding an paid analytics layer on top of it &amp; also 1 really interested feature which was highly requested –&gt; Tailoring: Fork your portfolio for a specific job or audience. Highlight &#x2F; Hide different things based on one specific job description for example.<p>But there is so much more!! We&#x27;re really exicited to ship an alpha version by the end of the year and would be so happy if you share what you think :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
