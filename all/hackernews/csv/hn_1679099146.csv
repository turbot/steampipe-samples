I had a chat session with one today and he asked the stupidest questions ever and rated the chat bad at the end after I said that I’m sorry I don’t understand his question. He then cancelled his membership. I feel like users are hard to deal with. First we’re giving them unbeatable prices and all they want is free. We have to do lifetime deals or huge discounts to get them onboard. When they pay a small amount for membership, they expect spectacular service and for you to be at their beck and call. It’s really hard to make a profit. I love business but I hate customers. What do you guys think?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
