I’m not adding a link as it’s kinda NSFW and might be offensive to some. It’s a dating site for men who like to meet other men.<p>The main selling point of the site is that it’s private and untracked. I’ve been trying to advertise on Google and they didn’t just disapprove of the ad (nothing explicit at all), but they also suspended my entire Adwords account for “circumvention”.. twitter won’t approve my ads either.<p>From a functionality POV it’s all working and the current set of features will always be free, so cost is not a barrier for users either.<p>I’ve created a blog and wrote some articles to try and get some google traction that way, but that’d also not too effective at this point. The twitter account is slowly getting followers, but that doesn’t seem to translate to actual sign-ups.<p>I’m a developer, but to be fair the site is an online asset worth at least $10k, what do I do to get people on my site? Any input would be appreciated. :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
