35336326,Ask HN: Does your Windows Precision Touchpad work the same way?,2023-03-28T05:33:02Z,EsportToys,1,false,false,,,,,," I wrote a simple little script[0] that lets me use Three-Finger Drag on Windows for my Surface Pro, by reading the touchpad&#x27;s raw HID report via the RawInput WinAPI, then use the SendInput API to synthesize mouse movement and button clicks.<p>I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to work with the HidP_*[1] APIs, so instead I simply reverse-engineered how to interpret the HID report&#x27;s raw bytes using my RawinputViewer[2] to physically stare at how the hex values change based on how many fingers and where I put them on the touchpad.<p>So this means that the script works for my Surface Pro which is good enough for my personal use, but I&#x27;m curious about whether this HID report format is common to all Windows Precision Touchpads or if it is just for my specific Surface Pro, and how general I can make it work without resorting to using the HiDP_* calls.<p>If you are on Windows, what do you observe when you examine the raw hex values using RawinputViewer? 
You&#x27;ll need to tick the &quot;Other Human-Interface Devices&quot; checkbox and untick Mouse and Keyboard, so that you don&#x27;t get the driver-synthesized SendInput mouse reports flooding the output box.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EsportToys&#x2F;PrecisionThreeFingerDrag<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows-hardware&#x2F;drivers&#x2F;hid&#x2F;introduction-to-hid-concepts<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EsportToys&#x2F;RawinputViewer",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
