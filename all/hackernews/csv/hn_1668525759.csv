As of today, Fiberplane is in public beta.<p>Before Fiberplane, you’d need to cobble together information from teammates and alert tools like PagerDuty in Slack, switch to dashboard Nr. X to look at the data, screenshot it, switch back to Slack, paste, and then rinse and repeat, all while critical services were down. Then you’d do this dance all over again but now pasting screenshots into a Google Doc.<p>With Fiberplane, when you have an incident, the team can all get together in one Notebook, query and show data, tag teammates and assign actions, resolve it, and then write a post-mortem directly from the investigation Notebook.<p>We’ve used Fiberplane internally ourselves a few times already to debug some failed data migrations. Once the issue was detected, we’d create a Notebook, share logs from our api and use it as a live document while we were debugging the issue. When we’ve resolved the issue - the post-mortem was already there. We just had to edit it, make it actionable, so that when we reran the migration later – we had internalized all the lessons from the first run.<p>Here’s what we’ve built:
1. Integrations with some of the most popular open-source observability tools: Prometheus, Elasticsearch, Loki, and more integrations with other tools are on the way.<p>2. A WASM-based plugin system for integrations (which, in the future, will allow for 3rd-party integrations to be built and run securely) along with an open-source bindings generation framework <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fiberplane&#x2F;fp-bindgen"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fiberplane&#x2F;fp-bindgen</a><p>3. An advanced block-based editor: You can run PromQL, LogQL, and Lucene queries, and display Prometheus charts and Elasticsearch or Loki log tables alongside the rest of your content. Filter your metrics, and logs, highlight important records, and collaborate on your infrastructure data.<p>4. Templates are written in Jsonnet language and allow you to programmatically create notebooks and automate your Fiberplane workflows. They can have Webhook URLs attached to them allowing you to connect Fiberplane with your alert tools (or really anything that can send a Webhook request) making them a powerful tool for incident runbooks and post-mortems.<p>5. A CLI that allows you to share your terminal debugging output with your team with a simple command.<p>6. Our backend is all in Rust, using the Axum web framework. It also includes some fun parts like a custom Operation Transformation library that’s used directly from the backend and compiled to WASM for the frontend.<p>Fiberplane was created out of our own experience of running large distributed systems. There was too much context switching when working with monitoring and observability tools. Over the past two years, we’ve been working hard on the first real-time collaboration notebook for the observability space to make infrastructure debugging faster and easier.<p>We’re launching into public availability and looking to create the best debugging and incident resolution workflow tool for developers, Site Reliability, and DevOps engineers. We would love your feedback.",story,https://fiberplane.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
