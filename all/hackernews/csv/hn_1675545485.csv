E.g.: books I want to read, things I want to buy, stuff to explore further etc.<p>Right now, I just copy stuff and paste them into my notes app (Mac) but placing things in the right category takes time. Ideally I&#x27;d love something like selecting a piece of text -&gt; context menu -&gt; some app menu -&gt; select&#x2F;create category. Bonus point if there&#x27;s an option to create tags.<p>The above is the bare minimum I&#x27;m looking for. Obviously would love more options like storing images, nested categories, comments on entries, and SQL like option to query underlying data programmatically.<p>I could write my own browser extension, maybe with a companion app but figured I&#x27;d ask here before re-inventing the wheel.<p>[1] Criteria for best:
- Speed.  
- Privacy: would love to keep data locally.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Each team does CICD themselves and in different ways.  Each team has different patterns for sharing data.

They&#x27;ve been here for years, but constantly complain about the legacy codebase they&#x27;ve been working on.  We fail to hit our estimates&#x2F;deadlines and the response is &quot;we don&#x27;t understand the codebase&quot;.<p>3. PM complains about our velocity, but nothing changes when I mention that epics need full product requirements and designs so that we can architect things and actually improve the codebase.<p>4. Sprints are just buckets of random tickets.  Sprint goals are for losers.<p>For 1, I&#x27;ve brought up to my boss that we need more enablement teams and pointed to issues across many different teams that they would solve.  Their answer was &quot;hiring freeze, talk with the other managers to solve this&quot;.<p>For 2, I can see how shit the codebase is.  I get it.  But I&#x27;ve been here half as long and have been explaining how things work to them.  I&#x27;m exhausted from having to handhold people who are making no effort to learn.  I also think there&#x27;s a significant technical skill gap where these contractors don&#x27;t know how to architect solutions, but just create code bandaids.<p>For 3, I&#x27;ve talked with them about it and things change in the near term, but the next feature we work on will be a surprise, dumped on us last minute in sprint planning.<p>For 4, I talk about focusing on feature delivery, but I guess scrum is just buckets of random tickets???<p>I&#x27;m a pretty experienced manager and I don&#x27;t know what to do.
