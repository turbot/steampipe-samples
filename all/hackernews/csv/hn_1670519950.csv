I recall that when I first saw it a few months ago I was really engaged and took some time to go back and forth between TLS 1.2 &amp; 1.3 to explore the differences.

(It&#x27;s just my second project in svelte, this time around I learned about routing and adapters to publish, pretty good stuff.)<p>Of course I started with grandiose ideas to make the ultimate solana parser and explain every possible tx.

Needless to say, that was painfully slow.<p>As I was trying to rewrite the file upload functionality in Busboy, I realized how events aren&#x27;t a good mental model for `multipart&#x2F;form-data` requests, and async iterators were (IMO) much more suitable for the task.<p>And so, this library was born.<p>API TL;DR:<p>- No temporary files are created, files are not loaded in memory.
- No need to provide storage engines, file handlers, event listeners, etc.
- The main (and only) function returns a Promise that resolves when all fields are parsed, and the first file is encountered (or the request ended).
- The promise contains a populated `fields` object, and a `files` `AsyncIterator&#x2F;AsyncIterable`.
- Asynchronously iterate over the files using the `for-await-of` loop or using the `next()` method.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate for any critique and feedback on the API &amp; the documentation :)",story,https://github.com/rafasofizada/pechkin,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
