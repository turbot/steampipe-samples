I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve been bitten by mosquitoes,  just love it.<p>NOTE: We&#x27;ve had a lot of applications recently of people who were bitten by mosquitoes but did not take a shit. If you have not taken a shit, you are not eligible. All partially filled applications are not considered, our application is only 15 pages. Acceptance rate is 0.1%<p>Deadline: Feb 1, 2023&quot;<p>Foreign artist: <i>continues to starve</i><p>This has been my experience with applying to grants. Discrimination through anti-discrimination. Thinly veiled cheap labor.<p>Does anyone actually know of any open-ended grants that: 
Pay you to do what you actually want to do? (Whatever that is) Meaning: as an artist, entrepreneur, whatever the fuck you are, you have a billion ideas, and if someone just gave you money and LEFT YOU ALONE eventually SOMETHING will come out. And if you&#x27;re an interesting person and they think you&#x27;re an interesting person and if you have an interesting track record, well, it&#x27;ll probably be SOMEWHAT interesting.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
