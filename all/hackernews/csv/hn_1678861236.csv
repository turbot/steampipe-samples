When GPT was reasoning about the tax problem, I got very confused. If this model predicts what word comes next (I know its much much more complicated), how can it understand and reason about a problem?<p>Is it a hand picked problem which it can solve accurately and will fail in future when given similar tasks?<p>Or is there some other module which gives GPT its reasoning ability?<p>Or is it some sort of emergent property of a system which predicts next word and has been trained on a huge amount of data?<p>I know they haven&#x27;t released much in the paper, but I want to know if anyone has any theories about this.<p>Also, if it can understand and reason about a given block of text, why not give it description of a already solved but very complicated math &#x2F; physics problem and ask it to solve that. If it can successfully solve that, we can try with an unsolved problem.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
