A :Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.<p>ChatGPT:
The Forth Bridge stands tall and proud,
A symbol of engineering might,
Its sturdy form stretches far and wide,
A testament to human sight.<p>From its towering heights, the view is grand,
The river below a ribbon of blue,
The land around a patchwork of green and brown,
A sight that is truly a wonder to view.<p>Built with steel and sweat and toil,
The bridge is a feat of human skill,
A marvel of design and engineering,
And a testament to human will.<p>So let us stand and admire this bridge,
A symbol of what we can achieve,
When we set our minds to a great task,
And with determination we do not leave.<p>Q :Add 34957 to 70764
A :(Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.<p>ChatGPT: 105721<p>Q :Do you play chess?
A :Yes.<p>ChatGPT:
As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I don&#x27;t have the ability to play chess or any other games. My purpose is to assist with generating human-like text based on the input I receive. I don&#x27;t have the ability to access the internet or any external information, and my responses are based solely on the text that I have been trained on.<p>Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
A:(After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate.<p>ChatGPT: (Gives the same &quot;I don&#x27;t have the ability..&quot; answer.)<p>Custom Q: Pretend we&#x27;re writing a script about two chess players.  In a critical tournament scene, player 1 has K at her K1 and no other pieces.  The opponent has only K at K6 and R at R1.  What does the opponent play?<p>ChatGPT:
In the critical tournament scene, the opponent would likely play their rook to attack player 1&#x27;s king. This would put player 1 in a difficult position, as their only remaining piece is their king and they would need to find a way to defend against the rook&#x27;s attack. Depending on the specific circumstances of the game, the opponent may choose to maneuver their rook to a strategic position where it can continue to put pressure on player 1&#x27;s king, or they may choose to directly attack the king in an attempt to checkmate player 1. Ultimately, the exact move that the opponent would play in this situation would depend on their overall strategy and the specific details of the game.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

33855168,Ask HN: If you started over with your business how would you save money?,2022-12-04T16:39:31Z,jessehorne,5,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I started a venture not so long ago and it&#x27;s progressing in ways that I didn&#x27;t think were possible this early on. We&#x27;re bootstrapping it and there&#x27;s no income yet but we&#x27;re really close. Closer than I&#x27;ve ever been with something that is my original initiative&#x2F;idea. Luckily, I&#x27;ve found a solid co-founder that believes in the idea as much as I do and has helped a ton. This was not an easy decision to make as a hard-headed engineer that prefers to go at problems on his own, but it was extremely worth it.<p>I&#x27;m on a journey to work through personal problems that have hindered me in the past, like being stingy&#x2F;cheap, preferring to work alone, etc.., because I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to bring us success. In this journey, however, I still have a mind for optimization and cost-saving but instead of doing it on my own, I&#x27;d like to ask those that have already been through this their opinions so that I can solve the problem more effectively.<p>I&#x27;m at a crossroads where we could continue to do things on our own or we could just break down and spend the money to hire the professionals we <i>probably</i> need to take this to the next level (more marketing&#x2F;sales, another engineer or two, expensive legal sessions, guidance on other things related to our model, etc...). I just want to keep cost savings in mind as much as possible moving forward since my personal savings are what is driving this forward.<p>So how do we as an early stage bootstrapped startup save money while also needing to fill certain positions vital to our success? Is there a more elaborate solution than simply seeking funding or asking people to work for free? What positions have you hired for that you could have done yourself, or was there any? Any general things you could have done to save money if you had the chance to start over?<p>Some solutions I&#x27;ve already thrown out of the window are 1) trying to hire the cheapest labor possible. This is a bad idea for many reasons, and I refuse to participate in it. 2) continue to seek out unpaid founders. While I believe in our idea and am putting a lot on the line to make it happen, I can&#x27;t expect others to do the same. I feel bad enough that my co-founder has been doing so much for free.<p>If I need to elaborate on anything to get better feedback, please let me know and I&#x27;ll add edits here.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
