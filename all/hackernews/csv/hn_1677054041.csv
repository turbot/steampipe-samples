34892985,Show HN: Starter.place – Gumroad for Starter Repos,2023-02-22T08:10:52Z,ecuaflo,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN! Starting a new project is so hard because before you actually get to building the idea itself, you have to search for tools and figure out how to piece them together. With starter.place, you can find proven starter templates&#x2F;boilerplates&#x2F;stacks that use the technologies you want and get to building right away.<p>If you’ve made a starter repo you think others would find useful, you can immediately reach a wide audience without having to make your own site&#x2F;app to sell it and advertise it by posting on starter.place. Just focus on building the starter all while earning from it if you so choose.<p>starter.place is so helpful to buyers and sellers because buyers are added as view-only collaborators to the repo on GitHub, where they get continuous updates. Buyers can help drive the project by submitting issues and PRs too.<p>Let me know what you think! And if you have a starter template but are hesitant to list it, let me know what I could do to change that.",story,https://www.starter.place,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
