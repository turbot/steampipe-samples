33841183,Ask HN: Helping a stroke victim regain hand-eye coordination with video games?,2022-12-03T06:21:09Z,MrWiffles,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve got a friend&#x27;s dad who&#x27;s a three-time stroke victim. Prior to the first, dude was left handed. Knowing the guy, I think he&#x27;d really enjoy the Halo series of video games or something adjacent, but with his left hand being pretty addled and that being his formerly dominant hand, I&#x27;m really worried that being now in his late 60&#x27;s he&#x27;d be really really reluctant to even try.<p>My thinking, and the reason I&#x27;m asking here, is that if I could somehow get him to give it a try, maybe his brain could form some resistance to further degeneration to at the very least resist or delay the inevitable through enjoying an experience that would build up a neuro-adaptive&#x2F;hand-eye coordinative system as a result of that enjoyment&#x2F;entertainment experience (provided I could &quot;sell&quot; him on giving it a try).<p>Is there any research or even any anecdotal experience on this being a viable theory in the slightest? Anyone out there think I&#x27;m even remotely batshit crazy with this idea, emotional affinity for the medium outstanding? If I&#x27;m nuts in even considering this, fine, no problem - I&#x27;d rather that than waste his time or mine - but if there&#x27;s anything to my theory in the slightest, even if a remote possibility at best, I&#x27;d rather give it a try than not, provided, of course, it bears the slightest chance of success if vetted by another that&#x27;s either seen such success of possess the medical credibility to conceive of the same (which I do not).<p>Thanks for the opinions, HN.
