But I haven&#x27;t found a good way to replicate this so far.<p>I made a 70GB swap file on the off chance that it had something to do with it, but the pauses still happen.<p>What might be some good places to start in troubleshooting? Is there some system caching mechanism or something else I should look into?<p>I&#x27;d be interested if this leads to more understanding of what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes, so thought I&#x27;d ask here.
