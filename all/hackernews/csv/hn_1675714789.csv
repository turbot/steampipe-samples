What are all of you trying to do for you next role?<p>I&#x27;m having an internal debate about whether I want to continue in product, as it feels like a lot of my success was potentially driven by landing in good environment instead of being &quot;good&quot; at product work itself. It&#x27;s also been sobering to realize that as a PM you&#x27;re somewhat dependent on others to create a lot of stuff (i.e., you can&#x27;t code enough to make your own site and potentially not enough connections to start your own business). So, I&#x27;m curious what other PMs out there are thinking about doing.<p>My general background is:<p><pre><code>  - 5 years in product at fintech companies (credit cards, credit, and BaaS)
  - 2 years in management consulting
  - Can code enough to make a crummy CRUD app in Rails, some data ETL stuff in Python, and I know SQL well
</code></pre>
This makes my potential next options (that I&#x27;ve thought of, hoping to see if there are others):<p><pre><code>  - Another product role
  - Sales engineer
  - Bumping up my coding skills enough to be a dev
  - Attempting to do &quot;solopreneur&quot; type work</code></pre>",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
