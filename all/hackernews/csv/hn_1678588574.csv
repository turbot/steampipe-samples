35115644,Ask HN: Please consider donating your karma,2023-03-12T02:14:08Z,anigbrowl,6,false,false,,,,,,"As you know, Hacker News karma is the unofficial &#x27;insider&#x27; currency of Silicon Valley. Despite all the hype about crypto, rumors of insider trading, and alleged &#x27;data-washing&#x27;, the real power structure has always been right out in the open for those who know where to look.<p>With karma, phones are picked up, doors opened, generous rails shared at parties. It&#x27;s the grease that oils the wheels of innovation and investment that keep our industry doggedly moving forward, crashing through obstacles and crushing unsuspecting incumbents under the iron wheels of progress.<p>Now, our community is in crisis. Following a particularly egregious self-own, we suddenly find the community chest empty of pirate booty. Without an apparently bottomless pit of cash, how are we to continue disrupting markets and innovating normal people out of their jobs, homes, and sanity? That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m appealing to you, the veteran participants of Hacker News, to join me in giving back at this time of need.<p>If just the top 50 users were to contribute a mere 50% of their karma back to the community, we would have a pool of several million karma points. Those could then be distributed to cash-rich investors who don&#x27;t know &#x27;how to tech&#x27;, the deserving poor whose tales of development hell would melt a regulator&#x27;s frozen heart, or (if all else fails), combined to enable the creation of a &#x27;super-user&#x27; with such extreme industry credibility that they could lift up the entire tech sector on their shoulders and wear it like armor made of blinkenlights, crashing through the constraints of financial logic and rationality in general.<p>This community has been good to me, and to many of you. It&#x27;s time for us to give back.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
