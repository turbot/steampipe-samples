Currently it has about 20,000 concepts on a range of topics but that&#x27;s just what I generated so far, it should work with more obscure topics in the future.<p>I love learning about random topics where I don&#x27;t have a good background in like history or linguistics, but it&#x27;s hard to figure out what topics there (you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know) are in certain fields and what they are even about, so this was a way to get the high level idea about random things that I wanted to know about.<p>It also only uses the information in the GPT model at the moment, so obviously information can&#x27;t be trusted completely and you should definitely double check any information you read here by Googling. I&#x27;m thinking of doing the Bing Chat approach for the next version and adding references, but don&#x27;t have that yet<p>Hopefully someone else finds this useful even if it&#x27;s not perfect!",story,https://platoeducation.ai/#/notes/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
