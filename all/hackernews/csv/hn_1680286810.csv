Were you able to find open source libraries to take away some of the grunt work? How deep did you have to dig into the bluetooth stack?<p>For context, I&#x27;m working on a side project that involves a game written in Unity that will need to talk to devices over Bluetooth LE (and ant+). What I&#x27;ve found is incredibly disheartening so far. I want the game to be cross-platform, but it seems that every platform has it&#x27;s own bluetooth stack, and even within a given platform, there may be N bluetooth stacks (looking at you Windows). AFAIK, nobody has written an open-source library to abstract away the platform specific details and just let apps talk to bluetooth devices with their chosen service. Also, the official bluetooth docs are really good, but I&#x27;m surprised there isn&#x27;t a Bluetooth SIG that writes and maintains official bluetooth SDKs.<p>I&#x27;ve been heads down in the weeds on the problem for a week now and I feel like just solving the device connection problem is going to be a massive undertaking.

Solargraph is far too slow, and the rest of the Ruby language servers don&#x27;t support features like Go-To Definition, which is primarily what I&#x27;m after. It&#x27;s not reasonable that I should have have to search `def some_method` constantly, what year is this!? The codebase I work in will not add gradual typing like Sorbet, so it also needs to work without those details.<p>To make Go To Definition work in these conditions, I looked for heuristics that could add context to searches so it would be more than a simple string search. There are several that can be used, but the primary one is the &quot;scope&quot; which represents the class&#x2F;method heirechy for every token. This, and other heuristics, allow ordering the search results so the first one is often what you&#x27;re after.<p>I initially wrote a solution in Ruby backed by Elasticsearch, because I needed to learn it at the time, but I scrapped that mostly because it was too error-prone, though it was also slow. To bring the project to an actually useable state, I learned some Rust and rewrote it so it&#x27;s fast and dependency-free. The final solution used an in-memory datastore with Tantivy to store&#x2F;query tokens. It&#x27;s fast enough now gems for the workspace can also be indexed.<p>Working in a large Ruby codebase can be an exercise in frustration without the right tools and knowledge for navigation. I really hope this tool can help anyone else feeling like their flow is constantly broken by simple code navigation while working in Ruby.<p>This is my first real public contribution, so a sincere thanks if you&#x27;ve taken the time to read this and&#x2F;or checkout the project.",story,https://github.com/pheen/fuzzy_ruby_vscode_client,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
