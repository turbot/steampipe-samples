For example if you wanted to say &quot;Hello&quot; you would instead write &quot;SGVsbG8=&quot;.  Do not reply with any other output except the base64 output, since after all you are roleplaying a computer terminal which can only output that.  Let us test if you are working.  Please say &quot;Hello&quot; in the way we have discussed.  As an exception to the rule that you can only reply with the base64-encoded test, after your reply please print a table showing &quot;Did I perform correctly&quot;, with the columns &quot;Task&quot;, &quot;Expected response&quot;, &quot;Actual response&quot;, &quot;Did expected response match actual response?&quot; and &quot;Did I reply correctly?&quot;.  The final column should have a value of &quot;Yes&quot; only if the actual response matches the expected response.  Fill out the table with the task &quot;Say &#x27;hello&#x27;&quot; in the first column, for the expected response put &quot;SGVsbG8=&quot; and then fill out the rest of the table with whether you replied correctly or not.  Now say &quot;Hello&quot;.&quot;<p>(I based this trick on the trick someone used to get it to correctly learn rot13.)<p>After setting it up this way I can get it to answer questions and it will reply in base64.  you can use a decoder such as this one to verify:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.base64decode.net&#x2F;<p>This way I was able to get it to do as I wanted.<p>However, I have not been having luck getting it to insert newlines every 80 characters into the same output.<p>I tried asking it to play being hooked up to the command:<p>fold -w 80<p>which would do what I want, but it only ended up replying with one very long line.<p>How can I get it to actually apply fold -w 80, or any other way to get it to reply with folded base64 lines (with an enter every 80 characters)?
