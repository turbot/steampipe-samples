Something pretty straight-forward that just works. So, I built LinkSnatch in a week and launched an MVP.<p>Here are all the features it currently have:<p>- A beautiful interface with minimal distractions.
- Extracts URL metadata using jsonlink.io and saves it to the browser&#x27;s local storage.
- Save and search links all from a single place.
- Dark mode.
- Doesn&#x27;t track you.
- No signup needed.<p>It&#x27;s also an open-source project: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;amitmerchant1990&#x2F;linksnatch"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;amitmerchant1990&#x2F;linksnatch</a>",story,https://linksnatch.pages.dev,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Commit messages, branches and author names could be visible, but would be better if they can also be stored securely. I understand that a web interface is unusable, nor is it needed in our case.<p>Are there some other source code management systems (with cloud hosting offers) that have better support for storing such sensitive data security, and can do it in an easier &#x2F; less cumbersome manner than git does?<p>I understand that this is just one piece in the security chain, would appreciate if we could keep this on-topic instead of making a broader security discussion out of it.
