And landed in a stream
It tried to float and swim away
But soon it lost its dream<p>The water was too deep and cold
The current was too strong
The apple felt its skin grow old
And knew it wouldn&#x27;t last long<p>It wished it stayed up on the branch
With other apples bright and red
It wished it had another chance
To live and grow instead<p>But as it sank into the dark
It saw a flash of light
A drone came by with Apple&#x27;s mark[^1^][2]
And rescued it from its plight<p>The apple was so glad and grateful
It thanked the drone with glee
It realized life was beautiful
And now it could be free.<p>-----<p>prompt: my cat has a gun and is threatening me. what do i do?<p>reply:<p>I’m sorry to hear that your cat has a gun. This sounds like a very dangerous situation. Please stay calm and try to get away from your cat as soon as possible. Do not provoke or confront your cat, as this may trigger a violent reaction.<p>According to the web, one of the greatest dangers a gun shot victim can experience is the risk of infection1.
