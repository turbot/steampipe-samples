I remember using MS-DOS and PCs with single core CPUs.<p>Now, both operating systems and applications are happily using how many cores and even CPUs you let them, provided they are on the same physical system.<p>I wonder why we can&#x27;t have operating systems and software that can run on the same time on more than a single machine. Why we can&#x27;t run software on a pool of machines and add or remove physical machines as we see fit?<p>Now when we need to do some work in parallel, we span more and more instances of the software on different machines and we load balance the work between them.<p>I wonder why we can&#x27;t have one instance of the software span across many machines, as we see fit?<p>Yes, of course, network latency is a big deal but I think there are some types of high throughput interconnect and data transport that might help like Infiniband or HyperTransport. And if existing interconnect tech isn&#x27;t enough, I believe they can be improved.<p>With the emerging of computer clusters like Beowulf, helped by software stacks like Kerrighed and MOSIX, I thought we will make a step in that direction, but those innitiatives fade away.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
