Nothing against their EVs (not that I would have an informed opinion either way) but it&#x27;s not like we have that short of a memory of what kinds of vehicles they&#x27;ve produced over the years&#x2F;in the past.
Good on them for hopping onto the EV production but I just find it ironic.<p>But hey, if the shoe fits then market it i guess",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35177584,Show HN: Built a newsletter on startups in SE Asia and grew it to 10k subs – AMA,2023-03-16T02:53:16Z,amandacua,2,false,false,2,[35177596],,,,"Hey HN!<p>Two years ago, I was working my first startup job as employee #1 at a YC startup. I was 18 and new to the startup scene, so I read everything I could get my hands on to get up to speed.<p>But working at a YC startup in Southeast Asia, I focused a lot on SEA startup news and realized there was no quick or convenient way to stay up-to-date with the latest startup news each day. Articles were tough to understand (or had too little info), news was fragmented across different sites, etc — and I just had no time...<p>So, I left my job and bootstrapped as I started my own newsletter that would make it fun and easy to stay updated with the latest news in SEA startups in just minutes each morning. (Think Morning Brew for Southeast Asian startups).<p>I started publishing once a week to a few coworkers, family and friends. Didn&#x27;t really know if it would work out. I was 19, didn&#x27;t have much of a network and worried if anyone thought I was credible enough.<p>A little over a year later, we publish 4x weekly and have grown to 10k subs with nearly a 50% open rate. I stayed consistent, iterated as I went, and minimized spend while focusing on growth. Wrote it myself each day and only brought on my first team member (and started monetizing) recently. There were def a lot of hard days.<p>But I learned that tons of people found it difficult to stay up-to-date with startup news in the region too! We&#x27;re now read by founders (even several who are unicorn&#x2F;post-IPO), execs, VCs (even Managing Partners) and startup operators in Southeast Asia — and even outside of the region.<p>If anyone&#x27;s keen on checking out the newsletter, you can subscribe for free to get the latest news in Southeast Asian startups: www.backscoop.com<p>Have any questions about launching, growing or running a newsletter?

35177515,How to release features to different customers in both SaaS and self-hosted,2023-03-16T02:40:28Z,hu-beau,3,false,false,1,[35177532],,,,"Many organisations struggle with how to maintain a single repository and master branch to continuously deliver their software to their customers who require different features.<p>Some customers use online SaaS services, but some customers need to deploy in a private and self-hosted environment. You&#x27;re struggling with how to keep the same released version.<p>If a new feature is only built for one particular customer at the beginning, you&#x27;re struggling with how to canary ship a new feature to that particular customer and keep the same code for all the other customers.<p>You also struggle with how to respond quickly to customer requirements without involving too many engineers. If a customer success team can do that without engineers, that&#x27;s perfect.<p>## How to mitigate the situation?<p>Feature Flags Management Service is the must-have technology to solve these scenarios. Feature Flags is a modern engineering technology that decouples code deployments from feature releases, giving you control over who sees each feature and when they see it.<p>Feature Flags can be categorized into four pillars (Release Flag, Experimentation Flag, Operational Flag, and Permission Flag) in its lifecycle through development to customer success.<p>Operational flags and permission flags can be used to manage entitlements in software, which refers to controlling what features or functionality a user has access to based on their subscription or payment plan.<p>Release flags and experiment flags can help you to deliver a feature to a specific customer with minimal risk. It allows teams to test new features in production and progressively (percentage rollout) release the new feature to targeted customers to reduce the &quot;blast radius&quot;.<p>I wrote an article of how to use feature flags to manage and release features to different customers in both SaaS and self-hosted environments. I hope this can help and get feedbacks.<p>[Article can be found here](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.featbit.co&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;Manage-Features-For-Different-Customers)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
