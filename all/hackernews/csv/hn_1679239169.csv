You keep a mapping of extension on to commands.<p>This may feel like a solved problem, but a straw poll on Twitter indicated that there was nothing that worked quite like this. This solution feels like how I would expect things to work. There are comparisons with existing alternatives (that I know of) in the README.<p>I don&#x27;t know what direction this tool will go. If there is interest, I might develop it a little further (although it feels like something that should have a super-minimal set of features). It was under a day&#x27;s work, so I wouldn&#x27;t feel too bad if ends up being a tool that only I use.",story,https://github.com/Textualize/textualize-see,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m a new grad &#x2F; software engineer and have decided to learn ML and experiment with some models. I wanted to buy a PC for coding and ML experiments. I want to try running larger models and perhaps experiment with new architectures too.  I am also very interested in RL. (I am aware that I cannot compete with companies like OpenAI in terms of compute power but I still have a hope of doing something new in terms of application or architecture).<p>What would you consider the best investment for a begginer? Would a M2 Mac be a good choice? My main concern is that my initial investment should be extensible, so I could add more compute&#x2F;GPUs later if required.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
