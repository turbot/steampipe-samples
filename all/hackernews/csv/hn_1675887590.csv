34713448,Show HN: I made a dashboard tool that doesn't query but receives data from API,2023-02-08T19:26:39Z,_wei_,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN. This is my second attempt to build a data visualization product in 2 years.<p>Why I build this: I often find myself in a dilemma when I need to plot something: do I need a full-blown BI system or do I want to build from scratch using UI libraries?<p>The tradeoffs between the two options come down to the scale of the problem and the time and money you want to spend on it. Therefore I’m trying to build something in the middle to hit my sweet spot.<p>For many years one of my routines is combining ElasticSearch + Grafana(Superset) + data ingestion in JSON format. Now I use Pushboard to replace it.<p>The core concept of Pushboard is a data dashboard&#x2F;BI tool minus query capability. As the name and the title suggest, the only way to provide data is to push data through the API.<p>I find it handy since I can use Pushboard without needing to worry about the compatibility between frontend and backend. It opens a door to many different data formats like CSV, parquet and so on. Obviously, the catch is I always have to transform data to JSON. On the other hand, if I decide to build a custom dashboard to work with a random backend, at least I don’t have to write the UI code.<p>The entire thing is built on top of react, tailwind, echarts, django and a few other great libraries. Unfortunately, it is not open sourced at this moment. If you really want to try it out locally, I’ve uploaded it to dockerhub.<p>It is free to try at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushboard.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushboard.io&#x2F;</a> with some paid options.<p>Please feel free to let me know if you like it or not, or have any idea and feedback, leave a comment below or send via <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushboard.io&#x2F;Contact&#x2F;Contact"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushboard.io&#x2F;Contact&#x2F;Contact</a>",story,https://pushboard.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
