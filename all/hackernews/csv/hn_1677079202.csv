Despite this, Amazon has not made any significant efforts to improve Goodreads and the app remains unchanged. While there have been many newly developed reading apps and websites, an updated UI combined with a ‘better’ book recommendation algorithm isn’t enough to convince people to switch platforms.<p>My friends and I created Common Place as a way to offer readers a new and enjoyable tool to elevate their reading experience.<p>Introducing CommonPlace - the platform for readers to digitally save book passages and add personalized annotations<p>The idea for CommonPlace originated from a book club that my roommate and I were a part of. While reading dense philosophy texts, we encountered sections that were difficult to comprehend. Despite spending hours searching for specific commentary online, we were unable to find anything helpful.<p>Below is an overview of some of the features CommonPlace offers to readers<p>Over time, by saving your favorite quotes, you will form a digital library in which your favorite readings are readily available to recite in a discussion at work, dinner parties, or wherever you find yourself having interesting conversations (this is especially helpful for writers)<p>The true power of books is unlocked when you can search a quote on the discover tab and find other readers&#x27; annotations for specific passages. This functionality is extended because users can like and reply to others’ posts.<p>CommonPlace can also be leveraged to host digital book clubs, classrooms, and bible studies. Your public or private group is a personalized feed that can be filtered to find discussion questions, other user&#x27;s annotations as a lift off point for discussion, and much more.<p>We have some fun updates in store for the rest of this year but we would love people’s feedback as you explore the platform (CommonPlace is completely free to use).<p>Hoping that CommonPlace can inject some vitality into the reading technology space<p>CommonPlace Website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonplaceapp.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonplaceapp.com&#x2F;</a><p>CommonPlace App: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;commonplace-share-quotes&#x2F;id1606636545"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;commonplace-share-quotes&#x2F;id160...</a>",story,https://commonplaceapp.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

You should constantly increase weights, reps, use different set schemes, and that will make your muscles grow.<p>There&#x27;re many weightlifting programs, using various overloading schemes - linear increasing of weights, some periodic ladder-up increase, switching to different set schemes in case of failures, etc. You can implement all of that in Liftosaur.<p>It works this way: each exercise may define a bunch of variables, that could be changed when you finish a workout. It could be weight, your 1 rep max, number of successful attempts, etc. You can use those variables in reps and weight values. To update the variables, you define a script, that will change them after you&#x27;ve done all the sets of the exercise. The script may change them based on whether you successfully done all the sets x reps, or if you failed any of the sets.<p>For scripting, I added a super simple scripting language with JavaScript-like syntax called Liftoscript. It mostly only supports if&#x2F;else, variable setting, and has some built-in types like numbers, pounds and kilograms.<p>The app contains a bunch of built-in programs, they all are implemented using Liftoscript, and completely customizable.

configuring openstack infrastructure (e.g. building it from bare metal)...<p>However, I am now in my 50s, and want to move out of my position (e.g. away
from the organization I am at)... but it seems when I look around, there
are very few &quot;generalist&quot; jobs in the IT field (that pay more than entry

interesting? I feel like IT is going through the same thing that happened
to engineering and medicine... at one time the barber was a doctor. At
one time a Physicist could do it all. I feel like I used to be that person
in IT. You need a database, no problem. You need a webserver, no problem.
You need some service stood up in the cloud, no problem. Now when I look
at jobs, they want specialists, but I am the old jack of all trades.<p>How do you HN &quot;old timers&quot; who have chosen to move on and can not find the
old general sysadmin position decide which field to go into? I mean,
do you just wake up and say &quot;I want to get back into programming and do
full stack devops?&quot; or &quot;I want to go into networking&quot; and spend thousands
getting a CCIE? I am just not sure how to take the first step on the journey

It’s the paycheck of a Roman legionary soldier dated to 72 CE, during the period of the Great Revolt of the Jews against the Romans.

It details the soldier’s salary over two pay periods (there would have been three periods per year), and includes deductions for boots, a linen tunic, and barley fodder for his horse. Basic equipment would have been covered by the Empire, but apparently, these items weren’t quite basic enough (who needs boots or a shirt, am I right?). The deductions almost exceeded the soldier’s salary, which begs the question, “Why enlist?” From a monetary perspective, apparently looting and various other side-hustles often made it worth their while. One example is a loan between a Roman soldier and a Jewish resident from the time of the Bar Kokhaba Revolt (132-135 CE).

The main idea was to counteract the rank-upvotes feedback loop by using attention as negative feedback.<p>We received very valuable input from the HN community (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659), and have since come up with something that we think could be a real contribution: the upvoteRate metric. upvoteRate is an estimate of how much more or less likely users are to upvote a story compared to the average story. We think this provides more stable and meaningful comparisons between stories. We would propose it as an alternative to the simple upvote count (which is distorted by feedback loops) in the ranking formula.<p>A Hacker News client called &quot;Quality News&quot; shows this metric for live Hacker News data (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.social-protocols.org&#x2F;). And you can read about how we calculate this metric here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme<p>We hope for interest and support from the Hacker News community to encourage official ranking experiments on the Hacker News frontpage.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
