You can restore deleted content directly back to your library, or download it locally.<p>Before I built PhotoVaultOne, I had wired together synchronization to my local NAS to keep an offline copy of my content. While I managed to set it up, it wasn&#x27;t something I would recommend to a non-tech friend. Then, a friend of mine had a weird incident where they lost months of content from their library - we still dont know why, and with no way to recover. PhotoVaultOne is my side project to help with this problem.<p>Why?
- There is no backup in Google Cloud. Deleted content cannot be recovered (excluding trash, yes)
- Alternative methods, such as synchronization to a local device, or taking manual Google Takeout&#x27;s are difficult for many users to setup or remember to do.
- I could not find an existing SaaS solution in this space - so took it as an opportunity to practice building one. Its fun to build. :)<p>Unfortunately I cannot offer the service long term without charging for it, there are AWS infrastructure expenses that need to be covered. There is a free 3 month trial though, with no commitment needed, and pricing of the plans is as aggressive as I deared to launch with.",story,https://photovaultone.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

However it breaks on builds (timeouts) and changes the location of config files (&#x2F;etc&#x2F;docker&#x2F;daemon.json isn&#x27;t used anymore), thus breaking our CI as well as making unusable our config management tools until we patch them.<p>The worst part is that the change occured on thursday, and there was no release notes when our CI started to break. So I was actually lucky to figure out that it was just that and forced version 20 everywhere before we would break everything. And today I found that some build timeout or fail in non-deterministic ways as well which seems to appear on some older versions as well according to google.<p>So I guess the lesson is, never use &quot;latest&quot; version of anything, anywhere, as they can&#x27;t be trusted ?

34693233,Show HN: We built an open-source OAuth service for 40 APIs,2023-02-07T14:34:05Z,rguldener,3,false,false,,,,,,"Nango (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NangoHQ&#x2F;nango"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NangoHQ&#x2F;nango</a>) provides pre-built OAuth flows, secure token storage and automatic refreshes for 40+ APIs and counting.<p>Why we built Nango:
We built Nango to solve the pain of accessing OAuth APIs. Despite OAuth being a standard protocol in theory, it remains a major burden to implement it, even with the help of a library. You still need to add endpoints and logic to your app for the server-side dance, implement token refreshes, build &amp; secure your token storage, deal with redirects on the frontend etc.<p>But the worst part is that (almost) every API has quirks and non-standard behaviour. This is why we think open source and knowledge sharing is key here: With the templates in Nango we capture these edge cases and make sure that OAuth just works.<p>How it works:
Nango is a small Typescript&#x2F;Node.js service that handles the OAuth dance, token storage &amp; refreshes for you. It works with any language, API or framework. It is easily self-hostable for free, or as a cloud service if you want to avoid the burden of securing tokens yourself (that’s how we pay the bills). To get started we recommend you take a look at our Quickstart on the GitHub repo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NangoHQ&#x2F;nango"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NangoHQ&#x2F;nango</a><p>We currently support 40+ popular APIs. Adding a new one is as simple as updating a YAML file, so anybody can contribute one. In the coming weeks we plan to add a dashboard, a proxy to authorise requests, monitoring and more APIs.<p>One thing we learned from talking to other engineers about OAuth is that everybody has their own horror stories: What was the hardest OAuth API you ever used? What made it so difficult? We look forward to your stories and your feedback on Nango!<p>Repo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NangoHQ&#x2F;nango"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NangoHQ&#x2F;nango</a> &#x2F;&#x2F; Website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nango.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nango.dev</a>",story,https://www.nango.dev,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
