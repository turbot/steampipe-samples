35222807,To amortize or not to amortize software development?,2023-03-19T19:47:34Z,bluepeter,1,false,false,,,,,,"For startups and bootstrapped companies, there&#x27;s an extremely ugly new change starting in tax year 2022. Or is there?<p>Section 174 was rewritten in the TCJA so that seemingly all R&amp;D costs must now be amortized over 5 to 15 years versus immediately deducted as a business expense. Moreover, Section 174 explicitly notes that &quot;any software [development] shall be treated as a research or experimental expenditure.&quot;<p>If you search around, there&#x27;s a ton of hand-wringing around this situation. On the one hand, most people thought that this would be repealed by now... but it hasn&#x27;t been. On the other hand, small dev shops are parsing Section 174, Section 41, and related CFRs looking for escape hatches. For example, there&#x27;s a lot of focus on language indicating &quot;for purposes of this section&quot; that may indicate that one can opt for dev to be a normal expense and not fall under 174 purview.<p>For more info, see:
