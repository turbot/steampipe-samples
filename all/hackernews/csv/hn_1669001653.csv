I know, it&#x27;s not a big deal to google it, but I would be happy to hear your ideas and opinion as well, here is mine.<p>My idea is to don&#x27;t let HW manufacturers to give a limit of unsing PCIe devices. I seriously believe it creates a huge amount of e-waste. Laptop manufacturers limit wifi modules to be able to use only the ones sold with the product, workstation manufacturers limit video cards etc. It is a poisonous practice and if USB-C can be forced on a phone.... It should be an easy move to don&#x27;t let manufacturers to take effort to keep their products NOT being upgradable.<p>I am not sure if any policy is already on the way. I think it would deserve to take effort for, and would make a change for sustainability.
