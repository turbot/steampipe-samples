I would like an overview of peer-to-peer, mesh and decentralized network algorithms&#x2F;protocols so I can make an informed choice. As well as some hands-on instruction for building a simple network from the bottom up. I&#x27;d imagine this to be the counterpoint of &quot;write-your-own server&quot; tutorials that many languages feature. I also have no idea how to solve the unique-identifier registration problem. I only have a vague idea of how BitTorrent&#x2F;kademlia works, and I could not make heads or tails of the purpose of cjdns from reading their white paper (can&#x27;t find the original pdf anymore). I&#x27;ve always felt mesh networking to be like black magic and am looking for a book for enlightenment.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
35447486,iOS lets carriers add WiFi networks that you can’t remove or stop from joining,2023-04-05T00:05:45Z,newZWhoDis,7,false,false,,,,,,"Well this was a major surprise so I figured I’d share it here to get some eyeballs on it.<p>Essentially, the latest iOS (16.4 at post time) allows your cellular carrier (via eSIM) to add “managed networks” to your device.<p>These networks cannot be removed, they cannot have “automatically join” disabled, and they have equal priority with your real, personal networks.<p>So guess what happens when your neighbors get a wifi&#x2F;modem combo that blasts a free hotspot SSID? Not only does it pollute the already crowded 2.4ghz band, your iPhone will often prefer this connection over your real &#x2F;local wifi (despite said wifi being at 1 bar).<p>As of post-time, these is no way to remove these networks short of completely disabling cell service&#x2F;removing the eSIM and resetting all network settings.<p>You can see this for yourself by going to WiFi&#x2F;“edit” and scrolling down.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
