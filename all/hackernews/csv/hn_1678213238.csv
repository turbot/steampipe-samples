For this we need to talk to a number of medical professionals within a specific domain. Since my university has access to a university hospital next door we were able to talk to 12 doctors and also the financial administrators to get info about budgets so far. While the feedback was very promising the incubator we applied for wants us to get in touch with at least 100 professionals.<p>Given that it took more than 1.5 months to get in touch with the previous sample group I was wondering if there was a faster way that I am not seeing. I already thought of faires, but the next relevant fair is a month away and we really need funding asap to keep going.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
