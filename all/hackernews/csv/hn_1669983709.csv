Power is provided via USB-C, which is also used for programming.<p>There is also a web-based animation sequencer to create lighting sequences in time to arbitrary audio, examples of which are on the linked page. This is similar to xLights (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xlights.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xlights.org&#x2F;</a>), but much less powerful, and we hope to release firmware to interface directly with xLights soon.<p>My colleague and I started kicking the idea for these around after making some custom circuit boards for another project, and thought we&#x27;d have a go at making smaller versions of some much larger exhibits we had made using 12 volt WS1812 bullet pixels.<p>I hope you enjoy them, Merry Christmas!",story,https://pixo.lighting,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
