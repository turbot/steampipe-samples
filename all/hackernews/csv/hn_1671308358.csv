It works across any server, and in the absence of a formal verification system, as previously seen on Twitter, this method seemed the next best thing.<p>It is my view that the basic task of confirming journalists are who they say they are is a critical need for any emerging platform likely to be used for disseminating news.<p>Many agreed. Too many. The waiting list for verifications is growing more quickly than my capacity to verify and publish, with spikes whenever a fresh controversy emerges on Twitter (such as the recent banning of journalists, for example). We have had 1,400 submissions, of which almost 500 have been verified — more than 150 subject beats, and 250 outlets.<p>The system works — but I’m clearly no developer, and this project desperately needs one. For that reason, I wanted to reach out to the Hacker News community for help in improving&#x2F;rebuilding the site with a view to a relaunch sometime in the near future.<p>The site is hitting usage limits for certain functions — I use a paid Zapier account to export new Airtable entries into Webflow’s CMS, but each entry requires about 3-4 zaps, quickly adding up. Howie Liu at Airtable very kindly comped a pro account so we can use more automations and add collaborators.<p>I’m sure with a smarter eye than mine, huge and obvious improvements are within somewhat easy reach. In case it’s not obvious, there’s no money in it. I’m an SF-based Financial Times reporter, but this is a personal project for which I’m footing the (thankfully still quite small) bill.<p>I have no idea if Mastodon will end up being the post-Twitter destination, but while we figure that out, this feels like an important job to be getting on with.<p>If you feel the same way, please do get in touch. I’m on davelee.journalist@gmail.com. Thanks for reading.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
