We thought it would be fun for April 1 to show something a bit on the silly end of things -- we trained our TTS model on &quot;Shakespearean&quot; theatrical voices, and used GPT to generate short plays which are then &quot;acted&quot; out.<p>This lets us show the versatility of our model, that we use in more &quot;serious&quot; settings for generating branded voices for particular languages or accents.<p>It should be noted, the dataset is of our own curation; all voice actors were compensated with full knowledge of being used for TTS and were thrilled to be part of a creative project like this.  We resample the speaker embedding space to find voices that are different from any one particular actor.",story,https://ai-shakespeare.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

(Only deleting it stopped the charges accumulating. FWIW Google charges only for storage on stopped instances.) Does this happen to everyone? Microsoft has offered to reduce the amount by about eighty percent but I still feel like I&#x27;ve been tricked into spending much more than I intended on a personal hobby project. Am I being ungrateful when I have only myself to blame or is it time to lawyer up?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
