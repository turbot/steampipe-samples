If 15,000,000,000 trees die or are cut down every year, and each tree weighs 2000 kg on average,
And 30,000,000,000,000 kg of wood rots every year, and each 1 kg of rotting wood creates 1.65 kg of CO2,
Then 49,500,000,000,000 kg of CO2 is released by rotting wood each year.
If 10,000,000,000,000 kg of CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere every year, we need to prevent 3,030,000,000 trees from rotting each year through sequestration.
Is my math correct? If so, how can this be done? And isn&#x27;t this easier then trying to reduce usage, or remove it directly from the atmosphere?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
