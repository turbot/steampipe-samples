This last mile of learning language is a pain. And it&#x27;s my personal problem.<p>Why Twitter?
Twitter feed is a source of hot advanced topics in short form. And it is already customized to your specific interests.<p>Such conversations give much more fun and benefits than discussing again and again boring general topics like &quot;sports&quot; or &quot;movies&quot;.
