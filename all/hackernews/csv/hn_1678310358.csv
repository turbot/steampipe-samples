Before that, we were using paper logs to keep track of his diet and how much insulin we were giving him, however we were burning out from the cognitive overload and constant second-guessing. Saltie has made it easier for us to save recipes, plan meals, and make diabetes-related decisions.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful that Saltie could help other families living with T1D.<p>Bigger picture, if I can assemble a dataset of high-quality blood glucose, insulin, exercise, and nutritional data, I think it&#x27;s possible to develop an AI that can predict what any particular meal will do to your glucose and recommend a bolus for it.<p>Technical notes: Saltie is a PWA built using a Svelte.js frontend, a Node.js backend, and a Postgres DB. The native iOS app was built using Capacitor.js, which allows you to connect a PWA webview to native APIs. So the entire stack is almost entirely JS based, which means I&#x27;m able to share and reuse a good amount of code across the entire stack. Very highly recommend Svelte if you&#x27;re looking for a new frontend framework - it&#x27;s been a lot of fun to work with.",story,https://saltie.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
