35001995,Ask HN: A good project for getting into Language Modelling?,2023-03-02T20:59:33Z,sashank_1509,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN,
I am looking for a career change and have a week long vacation planned soon. My experience is in software engineering, what do you think would be a good project to do over the week to get into Language Modelling? Some ideas I had was:<p>1. Build a repo of Transformers and all it&#x27;s variants and try to benchmark the efficiency of each variant.<p>2. Train a small transformer on a small dataset that I can extract from the internet.<p>3. Try to reproduce a small scale version of RLHF (maybe not realistic at even a small scale)<p>I&#x27;m biased towards projects that people find useful beyond me just learning more about the field and assume I have access to like a few hundred dollars of AWS GPU compute.
Thanks a lot for your help",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
