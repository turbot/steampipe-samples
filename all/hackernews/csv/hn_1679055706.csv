Bonus steps:<p><pre><code>  - randomly modifies its hyper-parameters, collect extra learning data, and trains itself,
  - generate a script with evil purposes (&quot;What would an evil AI do? Write a python script.&quot;) and executes it.

When we will have such a GPT virus, how will we fight against it? Patch all software? Create AI-free part of the internet?<p>(Please consider that any answer to this question might get into the training data of a GPT model.)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

For example, generating a dataset of ‘list of commercial properties in Los Angeles’ gives you a realistic address (456 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90026) and neighborhood (Hollywood) and relevant fields like price_per_sq_ft and amenities.<p>We’ve personally found this useful in quickly spinning up prototypes backed by realistic data that matches our use case. We hope you find it useful for all the projects you work on as well :)<p>Here’s how you can use the Mock API Generator for your own project:
- Use a natural language prompt (i.e. ‘list of Harry Potter characters’) to immediately generate a schema and corresponding dataset
- Fiddle with the data by adding, editing, and deleting columns and setting number of rows and fields till it’s just right for you
- Export your dataset as a CSV or generate a REST API that persists it with standard read and write endpoints<p>We’re also planning on building a Figma plugin where you can generate mock data and APIs to power your Figma designs and prototypes. Let us know if you would find that interesting.<p>Would love to hear some feedback and questions, as well as what you’d love to see next.
