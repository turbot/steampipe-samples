I recently felt in love with micro-controller programming, as I started building tools interacting with my home-automation systems (mainly to optimize energy consumption by getting and processing data from &#x2F; to photovoltaic inverter and heat pump using the KNX protocol to talk with other devices).<p>I knew nothing about this field, and at first I was confused by the amount of information is available online (I mean, should I go with ESP8266, With ESP32? What&#x27;s a NodeMCU then? And what about the ESP-12E.. or ESP-12F?).<p>I&#x27;ve embraced the ESP8266 fully, as it&#x27;s tiny, fast enough, has wifi built-in and.. it&#x27;s incredibly cheap! I used to make stuff with the Raspberry Pi, but it quickly becomes expensive when you need more of them around, and it&#x27;s a waste of power for most of the projects I&#x27;m dealing with.<p>I recently decided to start a small website to share the knowledge I&#x27;m gathering during the process, and even though it&#x27;s pretty minimal and features a bunch of articles, I&#x27;m keen to get some feedback from you guys to make sure I&#x27;m on the right track (I&#x27;m regularly adding new content).<p>Honestly, I like the idea of keeping it extremely simple (and fast!), and I think other tinkerers like me will benefit from having a repo-like website for quick snippets that typically we search over and over again on the web.<p>Also, I try explaining the code step by step, so that even beginners can understand it easily.<p>So.. you hackers out there, take a look at it, ad let me know!<p>Ah, btw, it&#x27;s cookie-free, analytics-free, ads-free and affiliate-marketing free :)<p>Thanks for checking it out!<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esp8266code.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esp8266code.com</a><p>P.S. [Meta-information]: the website is made with zero frameworks with just a bunch of shell scripts building static pages on my private VPS. I even implemented a 90&#x27;s vibes cgi script for the search function (I&#x27;m toying with the idea of making a blog article about it as well.. let me know if you&#x27;re interested)",story,https://esp8266code.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
