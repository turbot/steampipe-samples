I muddled my way through it a few months ago (am a mediocre git person and only use the CLI; am open to IDEs you like if they will help me).<p>A couple days ago that PAT expired. My first problem is that AFAIK error messages just tell you things are failing, not that the reason why is the PAT expiration.<p>I am in some kind of special hell trying to revive my repo. I will cheerfully admit I just started trying random things, like using stack overflow answers I didn&#x27;t understand. Now my repo is in accessible. You may say it&#x27;s my fault for being a doofus, and I won&#x27;t disagree. Obvious point here is to RTFM.<p>But I can&#x27;t find overview material on the PATs at either https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;doc or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;get-started. Certainly not how they interact with error messages or the CLI.

Any advice&#x2F;perspective is appreciated.<p>I am a 40+ year old self-taught software developer. I&#x27;ve been doing front-end&#x2F;full stack development for most of my 10+ year career. I was also struggling heavily with undiagnosed ADHD and the emotional dysregulation that comes with it for most of my life. I finally discovered it 3+ years ago after around 5 years in therapy and have put in an incredible amount of work since then to learn how to manage it all effectively.<p>Through this process, I&#x27;ve also come to find a real joy in my work. Now I just need a good job to get my life back on track.<p>I have been interviewing since December or so and have realized that I do not approach this work in my head the same as engineers that have gone through typical school and career trajectories. Most of my roles have been through recommendations which short-circuited the typical tech interviews or was I hired by non-technical people who only cared about the output, so I have been fortunate in that regard. However, that fortune has become a burden and made it incredibly hard to navigate tech interviews where I am mostly graded on my ability to interview and how homogeneous I am.<p>In my off time I have been learning new languages, doing coding exercises and working on personal projects to try to display proficiency, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. I submit applications and receive only form rejection letters, people reach out about work and after a conversation I never hear from them again. When I do get the interview, the questions seem unnatural and designed to garner a specific response rather than have a real conversation.<p>To top it off, I get exactly zero feedback and have no idea if I&#x27;m going through a process with a successful ending or just banging my head against the wall.  I&#x27;m willing to do take-home coding tests or even a short contract-to-hire period to prove myself, but I&#x27;m not even being asked. I think most devs may not be ok with that, and maybe that&#x27;s partly why, but it&#x27;s a perfect opportunity for me to overcome concerns during the interview.<p>Am I on the right track and just experiencing what most people go through? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any thoughts or ideas on how to overcome this?<p>If you got this far, thank you.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
