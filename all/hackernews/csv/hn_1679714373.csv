Up until recently did I not know it also makes it harder to bargain for higher pay.<p>* Didn&#x27;t change my job search strategy for a long time after graduating. For the first 7 years I was only using Craigslist for local jobs and didn&#x27;t consider many bigger boards or alternative avenues (direct apply on corp websites, contact recruiters first)<p>* I don&#x27;t really keep up with my co-workers outside of work for other things like referring them to jobs etc. so my network is rather weak for getting job leads.<p>Things that I did not know I want to see others help prevent these knowledge gaps and fill them, before they start their career or when they are early in their career. Especially for the self-taught people.<p>I&#x27;m still learning a lot myself, as I still haven&#x27;t yet succeeded in re-launching my career. But I&#x27;d like to find out if there are others out there who are making efforts at preventing new developers from making the same mistakes I did.
