35305942,Ask HN: How will AI tools affect your participation in open source?,2023-03-25T19:05:27Z,japhyr,2,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;ve had some brief conversations about this, and I&#x27;m curious if anyone here has thoughts. With all of these code-adjacent tools coming out, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine a number of AI tools starting to open issues and PRs on open source projects.<p>If you&#x27;re an OS maintainer or contributor, does this affect your willingness to keep contributing? Do you feel differently about responding to an issue opened by an AI tool? What if it&#x27;s not clear which issues are coming from AI tools and which are from people?<p>I have contributed to open source for years, because I like to help people and I&#x27;ve certainly benefited from the contributions of others. But I have to admit, a good part of the appeal has been the interactions with other people throughout the process. I think my attitude towards open source work is going to be different if there&#x27;s an AI abstraction layer between my work and other humans.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

If they make the model publicly available like the training dataset is public, it’s not a problem.<p>I may sound pessimistic but without equitable sharing, in a few years, the AI powers can get concentrated in a very small group of people’s hands.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
