34774385,Show HN: Get ChatGPT to organise your Notion,2023-02-13T15:14:12Z,igorzij,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN, Igor here, I&#x27;ve built this thing last night.<p>I&#x27;ve been obsessed with note-taking for a while, using Evernote for over 10 years, then moved to Notion. My ongoing frustration was that when you have a thought to capture, the last thing you want is to spend time navigating the note-taking app&#x27;s UI. I just want to write it! This is especially painful on spotty connections on mobile.<p>So about a year ago I&#x27;ve built a Telegram bot that saves notes in Notion. All into one page, which is obviously a problem - it is now enormous. But to my surprise, I completely stopped using Evernote and Notion apps to write things down. It&#x27;s easier to search later than to struggle with the app in the moment of writing. Indeed, chat apps are built for frictionless writing on the go - unlike apps like Notion and Evernote.<p>Also, as a team we tend to capture meeting notes, retrospectives and other points in Slack rather than in Notion. Some critical distilled bits still go to Notion but Slack is so much easier.<p>But one thing was missing - the UI to &quot;route&quot; the notes. I thought of something like inline buttons in the chat, or maybe a separate chat-like app that would have categories or some sort of a &quot;tree-like&quot; navigation after you enter the note. This seemed like a rabbit whole, there was no right way in sight.<p>And then over the weekend it clicked - the right UI is _no UI_. Note routing should be automatic! It is possible to tell what the note is about from its content, even without LLMs, but with things like ChatGPT that&#x27;s just trivial. So, last night I&#x27;ve replaced the single-page logic with a page selector that picks the right page based on note&#x27;s content.<p>Now I&#x27;m thinking what it can also be used for and it&#x27;s starting to look kind of crazy. What if something like this ends up with a &quot;knowledge routing&quot; layer? You just throw ideas, links, screenshots to it and it makes it readily available for everyone in your organisation. Different input sources (Slack, Teams) and more destinations eg Confluence. Also the matching right now only uses subpage titles - but it could use all of the notes to make matching 100% precise.<p>Anyways - what do you all think? Give it a try!",story,https://notability.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
