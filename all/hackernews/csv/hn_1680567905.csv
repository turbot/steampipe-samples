I really liked it and want to re-read; this is the plot of the story:<p>&gt; Humans discovered through space observation that they are actually a simulation inside some other civilization. The catch is that because we run on their computers, our time goes way faster than theirs.

A recruiter  from a company recently reached out to me, and I was interested in it both because (1) they&#x27;d built an open-source project I liked, and (2) I knew my company was building something very similar, and even did a product analysis of the other company.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely interested in joining the other company. But I don&#x27;t have a clear sense of what I should be sharing with whom. My own company&#x27;s product isn&#x27;t out yet, so I don&#x27;t feel comfortable sharing with the other company (which I would likely join instead of my own company) that we&#x27;re building a competing product -- though I&#x27;m not on the team that&#x27;s working on it.<p>I also don&#x27;t feel fully comfortable asking probing questions about the business or engineering of the start-up, even though it&#x27;s really important to do so to evaluate a company before joining -- it feels kind of wrong for me to be getting good information that I could potentially then use to help my own company&#x27;s product.<p>Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this situation?<p>Thanks.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
