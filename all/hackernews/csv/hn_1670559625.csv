I&#x27;ve seen posts about Software Engineer jobs vanishing in 5 years thanks to ChatGPT. Artists are terrified that they will lose their lively-hood thanks to StableDiffusion etc.<p>Most of this chatter I have seen on Twitter, but there are artist communities battling AI communities on Reddit as well.<p>I personally think that everyone will just need to adapt as it has always been, but I am curious what others on HN think.<p>Are professionals in for a rude awakening? Are artists and software engineers and writers really going to be replaced with AI?<p>Will software engineering involve product managers talking to ChatGPT instead of Engineers, and if we&#x27;re still in the mix, will our salaries be substantially reduced?<p>Obviously the technology will have SOME impact, even if there is no &quot;apocalypse&quot;, so how should professionals be viewing this?<p>What are the best ways to prepare for the inevitable shift?
