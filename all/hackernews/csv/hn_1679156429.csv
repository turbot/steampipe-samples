35209967,Ask HN: Thinking about going from React back to Backbone?,2023-03-18T15:39:38Z,vaughan,2,false,false,1,[35210141],,,,"I often think back to how simple Backbone.js was.<p>You could read the entire source code quite easily. Debugging was easy. It was so simple you could write it yourself in fact.<p>A `View&#x2F;Component` had a `model` property and a `render` function and that was essentially it. Views used data binding, so that you get nice fine-grained reactivity (in React this is a nightmare). You have full control of the performance too. I badly miss being able to manually manipulate HTML to get animations how I would like.<p>I never liked JSX either. I&#x27;d prefer to just use JSON. In React, I would always just pass JSON as a single prop like so: `&lt;Comp {...props} &#x2F;&gt;`. The ternary conditionals inside JSX are ugly as hell too.<p>It&#x27;s just way too hard to understand. You have to keep so many caveats and internals knowledge in your head to make something performant. And it&#x27;s impossible to debug or step-through. It&#x27;s simply not JavaScript. I remeber when people liked it because it&#x27;s &quot;just a library&quot;. It&#x27;s really not. It&#x27;s more comparable to an operating system, let alone a framework.<p>I think myself and others have just bought into it for so long that it feels impossible to leave. And things like write-once run-anywhere with React Native felt so appealing. And then there&#x27;s Next.js and friends.<p>Was Backbone + jQuery really so bad? Am I forgetting anything?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
