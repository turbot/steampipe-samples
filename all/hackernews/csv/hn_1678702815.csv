We&#x27;re building a multi-channel feedback management platform and one of the channels we&#x27;ve added is the Net Promoter Score (NPS).
That&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen already:&quot;How likely are you recommend this service to a frend or a colleague?&quot; and comes with a score from 0 to 10.<p>We&#x27;ve decided to add this channel to the FREE plan (as part of our PLG (Product-Led-Growth) motion). We want to provide it for free and would like to get a collective opinion on what should be the bare minimum.<p>Right now we have an in-app NPS prompts that can be configured on how frequently to show, when to show the first time, and when to show after it was closed with no score.<p>All votes go to the feedback inbox (whether it&#x27;s a score with a comment or just a score).<p>Any suggestions on limitations?<p>Thank you!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prodcamp.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;net-promoter-score",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
