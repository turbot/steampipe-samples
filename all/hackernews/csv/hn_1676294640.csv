make me productive.<p>I have tried various languages but still none of them resonated with my 
end-goal...until I have found Go language.<p>Go made me feel excitement I once had as a university student and to feel again
this nostalgic sense, it lifted my spirits and gave me purpose; purpose to 
create, to build, to share.<p>It gave me HOPE and I dreamed big!<p>So many things to build for companies and for myself...then one person with 
authority around Go&#x27;s core development came and demolished everything in 
a blink of an eye.<p>You see, before the suggestion to include a telemetry mechanism in Go&#x27;s tookit,
I didn&#x27;t feel the slightest agitation while thinking of my next project, while
working on a current demo for testing purposes.<p>As soon as they announced the necessity of telemetry for Go toolkit, it hit
me and it hit me hard.<p>I felt like witnessing a deadly car crash while being unable to offer any help
or even react.<p>This whole situation verified my concern that products that come directly from
large companies or corporations are not worth the hassle, unless you are 
yourself a big company that pays for such product or service, for professional
support.<p>I cannot stop feeling sadness in my heart for the damage they did to the whole
community.<p>No matter what I do, the pain won&#x27;t go away and I feel betrayed from my own
self for allowing such thing to happen.<p>Go development team, if you are reading this, thank you; thank you for the pain 
you have caused to a number of people that got somehow emotionally attached to 
such an incredible tool, like Go language.<p>I would also like to thank you for making me realize it&#x27;s not worth it to get
so attached to technology and that other things are far more important than 
this.<p>Take care and keep on demolishing people&#x27;s dreams, purpose, and hope.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34772945,Ask HN: Someone copied my code but it is complicated. What do I do?,2023-02-13T13:06:56Z,burning_hamster,3,false,false,,,,,,"Someone copied some of my open-source code and submitted a pull request (without attribution) to another, much more popular repository, that is also open-source but with a more permissive license (GPLv3 vs BSD).<p>Although imitation is the highest form of flattery, I was still a bit amiss. However, I feel reluctant to pursue the matter. You see, when I was a but a budding software engineer, I also tried to contribute to the repository in question. However, they rejected my contribution outright, and with good reason. My pull request &quot;fixed&quot; (read: changed in backwards compatibility breaking ways) multiple issues, not just the one I was claiming to address.<p>I then did what any good developer would do and created my own repository with black jack and hookers that served as a replacement for that part of the Ms Popular repository that I thought (and still think) was deeply flawed. Crucially for this story, my original implementation copied several pieces of Ms Popular (as it was basically a fork of a submodule), but since I didn&#x27;t know any better, I did not retain the license nor did I indicate what code blocks were copied (I did fix the attribution at a later date though). Now, 10 years have passed. There have been about one and a half rewrites, so none of the original code remains. And after a lot of consist effort, my little project now does this one aspect of Ms Popular quite a bit better, and as a result it has gained some traction (recently passed 100k downloads from PyPI and closing in on 500 stars on github).<p>Now another budding developer comes along and makes a pull-request to Ms Popular that contains a substantial amount of lines (including comments) from my code. The pull request explicitly addresses a long-standing issue that I raised years ago, and where I linked my implementation. From following the mailing list of Ms Popular, I also know that the developer is a student that as part of his course work wants to contribute to an open source repository.<p>What would you do? Given the history of my repository, I feel reluctant to pursue the matter. However, there also is undoubtedly an important learning opportunity for the student here. How do I indicate in the nicest possible way that there may be an attribution&#x2F;licensing issue here that I don&#x27;t intend to pursue in any way but that nevertheless probably warrants fixing?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
