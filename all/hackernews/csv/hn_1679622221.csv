It began with a bio of himself and the nomination form without much else.<p>The promise was for any nominator of a &quot;successful&quot; candidate, they (both?) would receive some cash award ($500, or something).<p>I believe there may have also been an article written about the experience.<p>I hope you find it...

However, I don&#x27;t like how I need to pay $25 per year to be able to publish videos&#x2F;edit videos. This led me to my idea.<p>I want to create an app that is like VSCO, but for video. The app would give you video editing tools, and it would be free. It wouldn&#x27;t have comments, and the followers&#x2F;likes wouldn&#x27;t be public, therefore you won&#x27;t feel social pressure when posting. The revenue model would be advertising, people can &quot;boost&quot; their posts to get more eyeballs, similar to how Twitter allows their users to boost their tweets.<p>I want this app to be a place where people can edit and upload their videos to share with their friends, without the social pressure of likes&#x2F;comments&#x2F;followers (the numbers game).<p>What do you guys think?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
