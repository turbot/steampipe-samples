https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;vitag<p>Because we need your input on what we are building, we want to make it easy for you to try it out at no cost; no shipping charge, no credit card. Nada.<p>1. Just to to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitag.site&#x2F;discount&#x2F;PHStarter2022?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fstarter-packs<p>2. Pick a card pack from our pre-printed NFC cards.<p>3. And check out (use discount code PHStarter2022 and you pay $0).<p>So what&#x27;s the catch?<p>The cards work with our free app (iPhone &amp; Android) that allows you to add content (including video) to the tags. And yes, the tags are locked, available in the USA only, and limited to one free order per person.<p>However, you can stick the tags on walls or desks and the app is cool and doesn&#x27;t cost anything and has a ton of features.<p>This is not a sales pitch (kinda, but not really), all we need is people using the product and then telling us what we need to do to make it better for you.<p>Will we charge for it in the future? Yes, but right now, no. And no, you are not obligated to buy it in the future. Seriously, we are trying to make this risk-free and easy for you.<p>So what can you do with them?<p>When you go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitag.site&#x2F;discount&#x2F;PHStarter2022?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fstarter-packs you will see we have a lot of different types of use-cases we are targeting. Of course, Learn More tags are pretty generic but we also have tags for Wifi. Take a look.<p>Next, in the app, you can add content to the tags including video, links, text, wifi instructions or even (and this is coming out in a few days) redirect the tag to a URL you specify.<p>Even better, we built-in reporting so you can see when a tag is scanned and what they did with the info on the tag.<p>And for everyone that already has an NFC tag, we have a utility in the app so you can format it to work with our app (basically, use any NFC tag you want with the app).<p>So if you are interested and want to try it out for free, then great.<p>Otherwise thank you for reading this far. We love NFC technology and hope you do as well.<p>Sean Jackson",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
