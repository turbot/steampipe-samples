Solve a problem: &quot;I hate getting into my car during winter because it&#x27;s too cold&quot; - Remote start
2. Improve upon existing products: - Our phone is now 20% faster
3. Trends and market analysis: &quot;Renewables are getting a lot of investment and attention&quot; - Green energy focused product.
4.

For example, adding touch-id to iPhones, if you go around asking people do you want a fingerprint scanner on your phone, they would have looked at you funny at the time.<p>Often times you&#x27;ll hear don&#x27;t create a solution, then look for the target audience.
