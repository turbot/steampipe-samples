The people conducting it have never been sent my portfolio site or relevant work. And I will then be asked some &quot;right or wrong answer&quot; tech questions. Which any dev would just google at the time and do not give an indication of skill, but rather memory retention...<p>I will then get an email saying that I do not have the relevant experience in a technology I have actually contributed to and worked with for 10 years.<p>This is a rant, but really the recruitment process sucks, and interviews are pot luck.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Here&#x27;s an example of a prompt that I believe represents the very limit of what GPT-4 can handle:<p>&gt; We&#x27;re working on support for paths in only&#x2F;include patterns. The match func has a bug: the dir argument is an absolute path, but we need a relPath, and we compute it incorrectly via filepath.Join. Instead, we need to compute a relative path against directory of .aidev file that this pattern came from. But that information is lost!<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s kill the idea of merging TreeConfigs completely. Instead, save a pointer to a parent TreeConfig loadConfig. Change ShouldIgnore to build and process a list of applicable TreeConfigs: builtin config, a list of configs for the directory, and override config.<p>...Overall, though, I did not enjoy using aidev for coding. Definitely did not save me time.<p>There <i>is</i> a part that I&#x27;ve enjoyed, though: having aidev write documentation. In a real project, you would definitely want to edit those yourself, but having a draft seems beneficial. The README of aidev is unedited AI output, so you can judge the quality yourself.",story,https://github.com/andreyvit/aidev,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
