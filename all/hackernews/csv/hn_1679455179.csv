35256379,Show HN: PromptMate – VS Code extension for pair programming with GPT-4,2023-03-22T03:16:12Z,mzitelli,1,false,false,,,,,,"I have been using ChatGPT for the last few weeks to help with software development tasks. However, I faced some issues. ChatGPT UI is not great for long texts, and manually giving context about code (file names, line numbers) was annoying. Also, switching back and forth between the browser and editor is subpar.<p>To address those issues, I developed PromptMate—an VS Code extension to help you use GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5) as a programming peer.<p>With it, adding files, functions, and code selections to your prompt is one shortcut away. Code snippets are displayed in a collapsed UI so you can focus on your question. The extension automatically adds metadata about the snippets that may be relevant for GPT-4. Then, you can talk about the code and get your AI peers to help you.<p>It was a pleasure to use the extension to develop itself. I am excited to share it with the community.<p>You can install it here <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=MateusZitelli.promptmate"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=MateusZi...</a>",story,https://github.com/MateusZitelli/PromptMate,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
