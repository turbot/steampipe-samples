The package has already gained some traction with over 60k downloads on GitHub, but I&#x27;m hoping to increase its exposure and reach a wider audience.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has successfully promoted an open source package on Hacker News before and has any tips to share. What worked for you? What didn&#x27;t work? How did you craft your title and messaging to catch the attention of the Hacker News community?<p>If you&#x27;re interested in checking out the package, it&#x27;s available on GitHub here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orhanerday&#x2F;open-ai<p>Any feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated!
