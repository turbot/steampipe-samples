35294209,Ask HN: Does anyone need data 'shuffled' in a large DB table?,2023-03-24T19:25:04Z,didgetmaster,1,false,false,1,[35294379],,,,"If you have relational data (stored in a table, a CSV file, or a Json file) there might be a need to mix it all up for testing or anonymity purposes.<p>So you might have a table with 20 columns (e.g. name, address, city, state, country, order_date, etc.) and a few million rows of customer data. Is there value in being able to mix up some or all of the data within a single column, multiple columns, or all the columns? The values would remain intact, but just assigned to different rows in a random manner.<p>Doing this on a conventional row-oriented database could be very costly for time and I&#x2F;O operations; but I have invented a new kind of data manager that uses Key-Value pairs to assign values to form relational tables. I just realized that I could implement a feature to shuffle the data very quickly (e.g. reorder all data in a million row table in just a few seconds).<p>So a simple table with just 3 rows:
name|city|state
John|New York|New York
Bob|Miami|Florida
Jane|Dallas|Texas<p>Might, after a shuffle, look like this instead:
name|city|state
Jane|New York|Florida
Bob|Dallas|New York
John|Miami|Texas<p>I don&#x27;t want to implement this feature if no one sees a reasonable need to do something like this.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
