34853919,Impressed with AI's understanding of steering wheels,2023-02-19T03:18:11Z,andrewfromx,1,false,false,,,,,,"q: in the nickelback song photograph the lyrics mention he wants &quot;to sing to more than just a steering wheel.&quot; Why would he sing to a steering wheel in the first place and would multiple steering wheels (2 or more) satisfy the more requirement or does he need an entirely different object to sing to?<p>a: In the context of the Nickelback song &quot;Photograph,&quot; the line &quot;I want to sing to more than just a steering wheel&quot; is likely a reference to the act of singing along to music in the car. It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to sing along to music while driving, often using the steering wheel as a makeshift microphone or stage prop.<p>The line is meant to convey a sense of longing for something more than just the mundane routine of driving and singing to oneself. The narrator is expressing a desire for a deeper connection with others through his music, rather than simply singing to an inanimate object.<p>As for the question of whether multiple steering wheels would satisfy the &quot;more&quot; requirement, it&#x27;s unclear from the song lyrics what exactly the narrator is looking for. It&#x27;s possible that the line is meant to be somewhat metaphorical, with the steering wheel representing a larger sense of isolation and disconnection. In that case, simply adding more steering wheels wouldn&#x27;t necessarily solve the problem.<p>Overall, the line is open to interpretation, but it&#x27;s likely that the narrator is looking for a more meaningful way to express himself through music and connect with others.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
