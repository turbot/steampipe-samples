I think the enormous back catalog of things that have been published but then disappeared is sad.<p>Anyways I have a few hundred pdf files.
They have an image of the page and the OCR text.
The text will have to be edited by hand I think.
Its not in English.<p>I was wondering if anyone knew of scripts or applications that can take that as an input, 
do some decent formatting and typesetting and spit out a couple of different formats of 
eBooks at the other end.<p>There are photos and illustrations on some pages. 
I am hoping to keep them.<p>The images are ok but given the curvature of the page, and other factors
the images are not I feel ready to be used.<p>I could try to cut and paste it all into Word<p>There is also an extensive cross reference and table of contents that I have no idea how to deal with.
I presume I will do it by hand but it would take a long time.<p>Anyways if you have any tips for me on how to take the raw files and make them into pretty, easy to read
eBooks that would be fabulous.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
