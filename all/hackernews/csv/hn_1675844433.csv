34705454,"Ask HN: Don’t Feel Like I Fit In, Should I Complete My Degree?",2023-02-08T08:09:08Z,noobly,1,false,false,,,,,,"I’m two quarters away from either a CS or a pure math degree. I feel I don’t fit in inside professional environments. I’m currently self employed and make enough to pay my rent and live decently. I like being self employed but have enough free time to pursue a real career, without sacrificing my self employment income. I enjoy problem solving and don’t program on my own at all usually but when I get immersed in a problem I really feel ‘in the zone’, and I love that, and I love that programming is all about that. But to be clear I’m not one of the types that just does this stuff in his free time regularly. When I have a problem to solve that involves programming I love it. I love the flexibility in design and the impermanence of solutions, the infinite pursuit of the optimal form. I enjoy refactoring for example, but I’m just a n00b.<p>I really want a WFH job to couple with my own work, which also takes place at home. I’m sorry to make “one of these” threads but I don’t know any better group to ask. I’m trying to read books on self-esteem and stuff to fit in better and be on campus more too. I got a job for the quasi-government recently (USPS) just to get out of the house and I’m feeling the same way, like I don’t belong. To be honest, I want to be a good programmer but if it’s not a good fit I should pivot.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This was 4 years ago and I never thought it would get its legs.<p>Fast forward 4 years, I say I chalked up my initial gusto as irrational exuberance. But eerily, when I now look at the base of similar companies it&#x27;s like 2-3 that are in my space whereas previously there were 0-1.<p>What should I do? I feel pressured to keep iterating regardless of cost. Any help would be appreciated.
