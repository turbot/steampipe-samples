35117371,Ask HN: Is TikTok rigged to show pro-chinese content?,2023-03-12T06:29:55Z,siva7,3,false,false,2,[35117552],,,,"I&#x27;ve installed TikTok for the first time on my iPhone. Besides being shown lots of &quot;funny&quot; shorts, i&#x27;ve noticed a heavy bias towards political content mixed with funny shorts which is usually pro russian (supportive of putin), xenophobic (supportive of far-right parties) or pro police. Since there is no way the content algorithm could have derived the decision to show me these political shorts on some kind of profile tracking (i don&#x27;t search for these kind of topics  on the internet nor do they fit my own political views) i&#x27;m left wondering if the TikTok algorithm is rigged to influence the political view of its mostly young user base to align with Chinese foreign interests. Are you aware of any studies done in this regard?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
