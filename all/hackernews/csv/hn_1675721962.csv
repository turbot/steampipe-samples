People are less frank because you&#x27;re a grown human being and there&#x27;s nothing for them to gain from it. I consider myself really open to criticism and want to hear what people think, but not everybody is like this, so there&#x27;s also a fear of being reprimanded.<p>When you&#x27;re six and forget your manners, your parents can quickly correct you. When you&#x27;re a junior software engineer and break production, the senior can point out your mistake and help you to learn from it. But beyond this, there&#x27;s only really close friends, family, and significant others that can help.<p>For most individuals, there will be an inflection point where their parents know them less and less as they get older and eventually a romantic partner becomes the person most familiar with them. Then there&#x27;s a whole new person to learn from.<p>If you&#x27;re not dating, what happens? Nobody really knows you, unless you&#x27;re lucky to have close friends who you see often. So, there&#x27;s nobody to observe you and help you grow.<p>Hope this explains my question sufficiently.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
