35033944,Ask HN: Secure and simple way for secret/credential management in a startup?,2023-03-05T21:08:42Z,jason_wo,3,false,false,,[35033994],,,,"What is a simple and secure tool to manage secrets and credentials for a small startup?<p>How do you do it?<p>This is not a core of the business. It should be easy to use and configure so a paid service would also be good.<p>Consider the the following typical situation:<p>1. Small startup with about 10 technical people.<p>2. One or two are responsible for the infrastructure in the cloud like AWS, Azure, ...<p>3. There are also other third party services like Cloudflare, Datadog, ...<p>4. Everything (AWS, Datadog, ...) is  managed with IaC tools like Terraform, Pulumi, (Ansible). These tools need secrets to work. The simplest way for giving the secrets to the tools is via environment variables or .env files.<p>5. People work on their own devices. So security cannot be absolutely guaranteed. So I guess MFA and generated temporary tokens should be used if possible. To generate temporary tokens the secrets management service has to work e.g. with AWS.<p>6. Optional: It would be good if Terraform can also be run in the CI&#x2F;CD pipeline but only after confirmation of one of the 2 infrastructure persons.<p>7. Optional: It would be good if developers get credentials to setup small test environments in AWS. You can create IAM roles that only allow to create these, but you still have to manage the secrets for these.<p>8. Bonus: How to manage non-technical secrets, e.g. credentials for web shops to order supplies? Multiple people would have to order something. Store it all on a confluence page?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

At the same time, I understand that they smoke right outside their own doors which to them seems reasonable. (and is)<p>I have bought an air purifier.<p>When I am trying to sleep if my room gets stinky
I turn it on.<p>For various reasons I dont want to be running all the time.<p>What I would like is:<p>1. Sensor detects cigarette smoke
2. Start air purifier 
3: 15 minutes later turn off air purifier 
(loop)<p>That would give me the added benefit of getting rid of smoke when I am sleeping.<p>If it sometimes triggers because it thinks it detected snmoke that is fine.
If it sometimes fails to trigger on smoke is sub optimal.<p>How can I do this?<p>I am wondering if I can get a fire alarm to be hypersensitive.<p>However, I am thinking that hte concentration of smoke is low, making it hard to detect.
As opposed to a firealarm in the toilet of an aircraft which would get near 100% of it.<p>Does that make the project quite impossible?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
