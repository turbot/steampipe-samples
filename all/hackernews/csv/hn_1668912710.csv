33677528,Ask HN: What Do I Need to Know About Accounting for a Small Business?,2022-11-20T02:33:28Z,ghoward,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I am about to start a small software business, so when I read [1], which says,<p>&gt; Usually small businesses are terrible at accounting and finance, but even they typically have <i>some idea where their bank accounts are and what is in them</i><p>I want to know how to <i>not</i> be terrible at accounting and finance.<p>This was on an article about FTX&#x27;s &quot;creative&quot; accounting practices.<p>Obviously, I have no intention of being creative with the accounting for my future business, so I need to know about accounting. But what do I actually need to know?<p>Here&#x27;s what I know this far, thanks to learning about GnuCash and scattering to use it for my family&#x27;s finances and budget:<p>* The static accounting equation. [Assets - Liabilities = Equity]<p>* The dynamic accounting equation. [Assets - Liabilities = Equity + (Income - Expenses)]<p>* The account types. (The ones in the dynamic account equation.)<p>* What each account type is used for.<p>* Credits vs. Debits. (And I use those terms in GnuCash as well.)<p>* Which account types are decreased or increased with credits and debits. (Well, I use the chart in [2] as a shortcut.)<p>* The fact that every transaction must have at least one debit and one credit. (That&#x27;s called &quot;double-entry,&quot; correct?)<p>* The fact that the sum of all credit minus the sum of all debits in one transaction must equal 0.<p>* The fact that income accounts are for recording the gain of money from outside. (Bad definition, but that&#x27;s what makes sense to me.)<p>* The fact that expense accounts are for the recording the loss of money to the outside. (Again, bad definition.)<p>* That liabilities are unfunded obligations.<p>* That assets are either money, physical goods, or the promise of payment from someone else, etc.<p>* That equity is basically the catch-all of everything else I own. (I used it for the opening balances when I started. And yes, that&#x27;s the worst definition of all.)<p>* That the movement of money should be tracked in detail. For example, if I pay for something with a credit card, I shouldn&#x27;t just record the money leaving my bank account; I should have an account for the credit card and record it there, and only when I pay the credit card bill should I record money leaving my bank account.<p>What else do I need to know? What else would be good to know?<p>Currently, I&#x27;m putting these principles in practice with my family finances, including budgeting, but what other skills should I learn?<p>Note that I&#x27;m not asking about taxes or other country- or location-specific things. This is only about universal accounting, at a level needed for a typical non-fintech small business.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33657492<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnucash.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;v4&#x2F;C&#x2F;gnucash-guide&#x2F;basics-accounting1.html",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;ve been following the project aside from what&#x27;s just posted here on HN.<p>Standard disclaimer: nobody is being paid to work for my interests, yada yada, be that as it may, from the outside looking in, I have concerns and am noticing a pattern that to me indicate that tangible dev interest is waning.<p>Looking at git commits, progress-reports, blog&#x2F;social posts, HN posts, Asahi Linux&#x27;s momentum and dev-interest it had a few months ago is slowing down when judged by those points.<p>- Are there other initiatives out there addressing linux on the m1&#x2F;m2 aside from Asahi?<p>- Asahi was very productive independently over the past year, but not many others are contributing at that level or frequency it once had. Are any larger distros considering officially targeting Apple Silicon?<p>- Are there plans for Asahi as a project to accrue more formalized funding or structure to generate more interest in the development duties toward achieving feature completion?<p>I like the hardware, I like linux, and I like where Asahi is going. After seeing many passionate projects driven by only a few developers flame out or slowly miss their mark after the fanfare died down, I wanted to get the discussion going with regards to surfacing any alternatives or other movers that are addressing this, or highlighting any possible needs that Asahi may have that would enhance its longevity and trajectory.<p>I hope this post is interpreted not as criticism but as care and concern and a first effort toward getting help for the project if this is indeed the case. Rather than debate over the facts, and whether or not this is just the clearing of low hanging fruit revealing longer and more difficult goals for the project, perhaps we could use this thread to address alternatives and possibilities with regard to helping Asahi move toward completion.<p>Thanks",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
