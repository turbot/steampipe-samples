Initially I was confused, but then I suspected that my title &quot;I teach mathematics, problem solving, and the basics of research&quot; was mistaken as a service offering to solve students&#x27; homework (I assume that is the issue).<p>So I emailed customer support:<p>---------------------------------
    Hello; I tried posting a gig to teach mathematics,     problem solving and the basics of research(undergraduate and graduate). My gig was instantly rejected and seller eligibility removed; I presume because the automated system thought I was offering to solve their homework problems. How can this be amended or reversed, if at all?<p>Regards, Ioannis Konstantoulas
-------------------------<p>A few hours later I got the human (?) response:<p>------------------------
Hi there,
Thank you for reaching out to us about this issue. We understand you tried to open a Seller profile on Fiverr, and received our response explaining your request wasn&#x27;t approved
Unfortunately, this decision can’t be changed.
Your seller profile wasn’t approved, but you are welcome to continue using Fiverr as a buyer.
If there is anything else we can help you with, please let us know.
All the best, 
------------------------<p>So... that is that then.  To make this a little less depressing, can HN people recommend a service where I can offer one-on-one mathematics help at the undergraduate and graduate level?<p>I was going to create custom sessions for each student&#x27;s needs, create tailored problem sets to target specific weaknesses, solve the problems together with the student to give guided experience, and employ all the mastery learning techniques I have practiced over the years.  I&#x27;d love to get recommendations, but please do not recommend sites that will reject the above by bot and then confirm the rejection by human!<p>Oh, and how do I make sure Fiverr stops having write access to my github account?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
