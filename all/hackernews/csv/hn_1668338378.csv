It always happens to all of us when building a specific software that we think that a specific feature will kill it, and our users will love it. But after launching it, it turns out the exact opposite.<p>It happens to the best of us, even when u do customer interviews, and the only way to avoid that is through extensive large-scale customer interviews, and customer analysis with large and experienced teams, which is something that most startups can&#x27;t afford.<p>For this reason, I am building an AI SaaS that will let you simulate how your product users will interact and respond to a specific feature before you actually launch it.<p>I would like to hear your thoughts about the SaaS I am building and what you would love to see in such a tool, or if you even don&#x27;t think that I should build it.<p>If you would like to test the tool once its ready for early adopters, please fill this form so that I can reach out to you https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;vkZw2tvGhyoeySGQA<p>Just hit me with your opinions.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
