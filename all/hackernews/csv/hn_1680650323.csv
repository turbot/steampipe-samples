35446768,New? concept of app/server communication,2023-04-04T22:35:22Z,hiwmo,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello fellas.<p>I was thinking of a “new” way to connect apps&#x2F;servers that are both “secure” and enables fast development (node.js). The whole idea is to<p>* Define functions on a server. Each function belongs to a certain group.<p>* let clients&#x2F;apps register to different groups.<p>* let clients&#x2F;apps “run” these functions on the server<p>* Send back the response&#x2F;return value of the functions back to the client<p>Example:
1. On the server: RunRest.define(‘adminGroup’,save_data_to_db(gData) =&gt; {await mongoDb.saveData(gData); return ‘OK’}<p>2. On the client: RunRest.run(save_data_to_db(‘hello world’)) &#x2F;&#x2F; If the client is an in adminGroup =&gt; the server will run the function and send back the reposne.<p>I have implemented an example class (named RunRest), code available at : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noah155&#x2F;RunRest<p>The goal is to<p>- quickly include this class both on the server and client&#x2F;app side<p>- Add groups and functions on the server<p>- Run these functions on the clients<p>- No need to care about authentication, and authorization as it is done in the background
Notes:<p>The class should be possible to use both in the server and client code<p>- It is a lightweight, only REST requests supported<p>- It is not fully functional yet but should be soon<p>Now to the questions:<p>- Is this a “good enough” way from a security point of view?<p>- Is this “good enough” from performance point of view? (lets skip sockets and assume REST communication is enough)<p>- Is there any similar service&#x2F;OSS code already out there?
other thoughts<p>Feel free to add&#x2F;update",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
