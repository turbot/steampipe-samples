Some other services will use your face to know it&#x27;s actually you, etc.<p>If we only allow signups to certain services (Twitter is one example) if someone has verified their real identity, doesn&#x27;t that by default get rid of most bots? (barring criminal identity theft).<p>Would love to get your take!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
