However, as a general principle, web crawlers should follow the rules specified in the website&#x27;s&quot; and when asked further on who created the data set and method they used - The response is &quot;The dataset used to train me was created by OpenAI, the organization that developed and maintains my system. OpenAI&#x27;s team of researchers and engineers collected the training data from a wide variety of sources, including books, articles, websites, and other publicly available text data.&quot;<p>So - No clear answer as far as I can tell. It is obviously a near-impossible task to build the dataset manually (given the strength of the team) - Some crawlers would have been used (assumption) - If anyone knows or can shed light to it - It would be great.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

(I could be wrong, of course.) However, I am currently on an H-1B visa in the US, and I am unsure if it is possible to build a startup while on this visa.<p>I understand that it&#x27;s not a straightforward process, so I am looking for advice on whether it&#x27;s possible to register a company anywhere else in the world and run it. The company would be a one-person company with minimal time investment (less than a couple of hours a week) and is designed to be a self-service application.<p>I would greatly appreciate any insight or experiences shared by the community on this matter. Thank you in advance for your time and help.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
