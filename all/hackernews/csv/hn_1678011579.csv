These work in a pinch, but I bet there is a better solution.<p>One thing I imagine might work but haven&#x27;t tried is something like the Twiddler 3. Certainly the Nintendo Switch controller is very comfortable for me to use, so anything in that format would be good.<p>I&#x27;d be very pleased to hear ideas about not-slow text entry without a traditional keyboard, and especially the experiences of coders working with limitations similar to my own.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
