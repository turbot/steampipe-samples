33901624,Ask HN: Is it black holes all the way up?,2022-12-07T23:01:21Z,zoroaster,6,false,false,2,[33901656],<null>,<null>,<null>,"This is something of a rant, but I would greatly appreciate your reflections as it&#x27;s a subject that is very confusing for me. Many of you are much smarter than I am, so any thoughts you have around this would be appreciated!<p>People recently have been positing that the big bang occurred as result of a black hole (i.e. black hole sucks up more and more material, gains more mass, until it explodes in a big bang into a new universe).<p>My question is, if this is the case, is there (1) another universe &quot;above&quot;? And is there another universe &quot;above&quot; that eternally? Or is it (2) more the case that our existing universe expands, it reaches an edge of maximum expansion, and a gravity-like counter force causes it to collapse in on itself, until it again repeats the big bang process (eternal recurrence)?<p>Take the first example. If the conditions at the bottom of a black hole &quot;singularity&quot; are the same - you would expect parallel, equal universes to be generated each time. If the conditions were slightly different (i.e. one black hole has slightly more quarks than another), you might have a &quot;parallelish&quot; universe arise (chaos theory, small changes in initial conditions).<p>If the second were true, given no energy &#x2F; mass would be leaving the system, you&#x27;d expect the same situation to recur eternally. The &quot;universe&quot; as we experience it would be bounded on one side in time by the &quot;singularity&quot; and on another side in time by the &quot;edge&quot; (the point of maximum expansion) creating a fixed, spatiotemporal object. Why does this spatiotemporal universe marble exist and what exists outside of it?<p>I can&#x27;t wrap my head around this. Which scenario is more likely? Does any of this make any sense? If the answer is &quot;we don&#x27;t know&quot;, do you think there is a way to ever answer these questions?<p>It seems like we&#x27;re trapped in some sort of strange, fractalian experiment.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
