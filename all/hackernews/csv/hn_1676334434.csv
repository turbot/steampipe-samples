We like it, and have used it daily. Mostly for timers, shopping lists, conversions, radio playback, and as a bluetooth speaker.

Amazon and Google have not impressed us with their deteriorating privacy and consumer practices over the years so we&#x27;re hesitant to go with a device from either. I like Apple stuff, but my Wife uses Android so the ecosystem is a bit of a bust.<p>I know about Mycroft, but they want $500 for their device.
