Organizations need to run multiple Kubernetes clusters might fall into one of the below reasons (not an exhaustive list):<p>• Location<p>– Latency (run the application as close to customers as possible)<p>– Jurisdiction (e.g. required to keep user data in-country)<p>– Data gravity (e.g. data exists in one provider)<p>• Isolation<p>– Environment (e.g. development, testing, staging, prod, etc)<p>– Performance isolation (teams don’t want to feel each other)<p>– Security isolation (sensitive data or untrusted code)<p>– Organizational isolation (teams have different management domains)<p>– Cost isolation (teams want to get different bills)<p>• Reliability<p>– Blast radius (an infra or app problem in one cluster doesn’t kill the whole system)<p>– Infrastructure diversity (an underlying zone, region, or provider outages does not bring down the whole system)<p>– Scale (the app is too big to fit in a single cluster)<p>– Upgrade scope (upgrade infra for some parts of your app but not all of it; avoid the need for in-place cluster upgrades)<p>There is currently no standard way to connect or even think about Kubernetes services beyond the single cluster boundary, and Kubernetes Multicluster SIG has put together a proposal KEP-1645 to extend Kubernetes Service concepts across multiple clusters.<p>Flomesh team has been spending time tackling the challenge of multicluster communication, integrating north-south traffic management capabilities into osm-edge SMI compatible service mesh, and contributing back to the Open Source community.<p>In this part of the series, we will be looking into motivation, goals, architecture of FSM multi-cluster support, its components, and how it integrates with osm-edge full-fledged, lightweight, SMI-compatible service mesh suitable for cloud-native and edge.<p>More details, please read https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.flomesh.io&#x2F;kubernetes-multi-cluster-communication-with-flomesh-service-mesh-ce98534b4a4c",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
