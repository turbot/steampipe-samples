34810603,Is an Hourglass Better Than Pomodoro Technique?,2023-02-15T21:09:37Z,RadRobot,1,false,false,,,,,,"I remember reading about the Pomodoro technique a while back:
https:&#x2F;&#x2F;todoist.com&#x2F;productivity-methods&#x2F;pomodoro-technique<p>And I hated it!<p>It often breaks my focus right when I gain momentum on hard problems, or lasts too long for shorter tasks. The 5 minute breaks are anxiety inducing, since they have a time limit - not very good for reducing fatigue...<p>Overall, I find it very schedule-centric vs human-centric (our brains aren&#x27;t consistent clockwork as far as I&#x27;m aware).<p>I happen to have devised a method that works better for me accidentally: using a 10-20 minute hour glass that I was fiddling with while working on a project. I found myself working until the sand ran out and taking breaks afterwards. Then I thought about it a bit more:<p>HOW TO USE THE HOUR GLASS
1. Flip it to get started
2. Keep working
3. When you happen to glance at the glass again (you will naturally if fatigued or stuck),
   a. if the glass is empty and fatigued &#x2F; stuck: take a break
   b. if glass is empty and you still have focus &#x2F; energy: flip and keep going
   b. if the glass is still going: keep at it until you glance at it again
4. Repeat<p>BENEFITS I NOTICED
- This helps me get started on the task
- Doesn&#x27;t interrupt me when I have good momentum
- Reminds me to take a break IF I need to
- Hourglasses are nice to look at<p>For me, the most common case that happens is:
1. I flip the glass
2. start deep work
3. randomly look at the glass, and it happens to be out
4. flip and keep going
5. repeat until I solve the problem, or:
   5-1. Get stuck and fatigued, randomly see the hour glass and notice it&#x27;s out
   5-2. Take a break (either for the day, or a few hours)
   5-3. Repeat<p>Just wanted to share this alternative in case Pomodoro isn&#x27;t working for ya :)<p>You can call it Sand Productivity (SP) if you must put a name to it.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
