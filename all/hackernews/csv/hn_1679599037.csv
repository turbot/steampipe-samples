I&#x27;m a software dev and don&#x27;t have concerns with my technical abilities per se but am always second guessing how I behave or present my personality at work. I&#x27;m always professional and that&#x27;s not explicitly a concern but am rather focused about &quot;showing too much personality&quot;. I&#x27;ve literally always wanted to work as an engineer since I was a child and am genuinely happy and grateful to be able to work in a technical role (am the type who does not _optimize_ for pay because I gain more enjoyment just doing the job - yes pay is important too and that&#x27;s not lost on me).<p>To elaborate on this I&#x27;d describe myself as usually &quot;excitable&quot; or &quot;jolly&quot; in social situations because I genuinely enjoy talking&#x2F;conversing with others and hearing what they have to say etc. This often isn&#x27;t focused on &quot;personal subjects&quot; (unless appropriate) but rather technical topics (much of why I enjoy HN and other technical&#x2F;applied-knowledge forums).<p>My conflict is that behaving like this just doesn&#x27;t feel right. I almost feel that &quot;showing personality&quot; gives others the impression I am lacking technical skills or don&#x27;t take things seriously. The majority of people I&#x27;ve worked with in engineering positions seem so calm, composed, and stoic. I find these character traits admirable but they don&#x27;t necessarily come naturally to me. I worry that during interviews I come across as a &quot;risky hire&quot; and the behavior described is &quot;holding me back&quot; in some way.<p>This was mostly a rant up to now and it&#x27;s nice to organize thoughts and get to &quot;what&#x27;s the point of writing this&quot;?<p>I think working in&#x2F;at&#x2F;for an Organization is partially about &quot;conforming&quot; to the group and being able to fit-in (or just not sticking out). This can be relevant for career advancement among other things. At the end of all this I just feel that I don&#x27;t fit-in.<p>This is probably a double-edged sword and others may feel a similar way about things in reverse.<p>Regardless, am curious if others feel&#x2F;have felt this way and if there are thoughts about this dynamic in general.<p>cheers",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
35279155,Launch HN: Helicone.ai (YC W23) – Open-Source Logging for OpenAI,2023-03-23T18:25:45Z,justintorre75,16,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN - Justin, Scott, and Barak here. We&#x27;re excited to introduce Helicone (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helicone.ai"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helicone.ai</a>) an open-source logging solution for OpenAi applications. Helicone&#x27;s one-line integration logs the prompts, completions, latencies, and costs of your OpenAI requests. It currently works with GPT, and can be integrated with one line of code. There’s a demo at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helicone.ai&#x2F;video"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helicone.ai&#x2F;video</a>.<p>Helicone&#x27;s core technology is a proxy that routes all your OpenAI requests through our edge-deployed Cloudflare Workers. These workers are incredibly reliable and cause no discernible latency impact in production environments. As a proxy, we offer more than just observability: we provide caching and prompt formatting, and we&#x27;ll soon add user rate limiting and model provider back off to make sure your app is still up when OpenAI is down.<p>Our web application then provides insights into key metrics, such as which users are disproportionately driving costs and what is the token usage broken down by prompts. You can filter this data based on custom logic and export it to other destinations.<p>Getting started with Helicone is quick and easy, regardless of the OpenAI SDK you use. Our proxy-based solution does not require a third party package—simply change your request&#x27;s base URL from <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.openai.com&#x2F;v1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.openai.com&#x2F;v1</a> to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oai.hconeai.com&#x2F;v1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oai.hconeai.com&#x2F;v1</a>. Helicone can be integrated with LangChain, LLama Index, and all other OpenAI native libraries. (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.helicone.ai&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;integrate-in-one-line-of-code"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.helicone.ai&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;integrate-in-one-line-of...</a>)<p>We have exciting new features coming up, one of which is an API to log user feedback. For instance, if you&#x27;re developing a tool like GitHub Copilot, you can log when a user accepted or rejected a suggestion. Helicone will then aggregate your result quality into metrics and make finetuning suggestions for when you can save costs or improve performance.<p>Before launching Helicone, we developed several projects with GPT-3, including airapbattle.com, tabletalk.ai, and dreamsubmarine.com. For each project, we used a beta version of Helicone which gave us instant visibility into user engagement and result quality issues. As we talked to more builders and companies, we realized they were spending too much time building in-house solutions like this and that existing analytics products were not tailored to inference endpoints like GPT-3.<p>Helicone is developed under the Common Clause V1.0 w&#x2F; Apache 2.0 license so that you can use Helicone within your own infrastructure. If you do not want to self-host, we provide a hosted solution with 1k requests free per month to try our product. If you exceed that we offer a paid subscription as well, and you can view our pricing at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helicone.ai&#x2F;pricing"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helicone.ai&#x2F;pricing</a>.<p>We&#x27;re thrilled to introduce Helicone to the HackerNews community and would love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and experiences related to LLM logging and analytics. We&#x27;re eager to engage in meaningful discussions, so please don&#x27;t hesitate to share your insights and feedback with us!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
