The ability to run code and get feedback to iterate will allow it to get much better at solving unseen problems.<p>Consequences:<p><pre><code>   * Harder problems will be solved by top 10-20% of developers, much more quickly than ever before.

   * More common apps and components can be custom made-to-order by near-future-GPT-plus-Plugins as specified by smart end users or system analysts. 

   * If the amount of software work does not increase proportionately, the demand for software devs will decrease.

There will likely still be limitations for problems far from the distribution of the model&#x27;s training data. Only full-on human-level AGI can solve that sort of problems, and no one can predict with certainty what the world will look like once it emerges.<p>What do you think of the above hypothesis?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
