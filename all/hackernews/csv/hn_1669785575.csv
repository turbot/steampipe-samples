Check us out at: www.lean.social
Our biggest struggle right now is our video streaming infrastructure and its prohibitive cost. We are using P2P WebRTC and each video room has a limit of 5 participants. There is no cost but it&#x27;s very limiting and low-performance.
If we wanted more, we have 2 options:
1&#x2F; Buy a video sdk server plan (Twilio, Daily.co, Agora, Amazon Chime, etc):
- The cheapest these can get is 0.0015$ per participant minute. Without scale it is 0.004$&#x2F;participant minute
- This is prohibitively expensive for us with limited funding. 1000 users using our service for 2 hours daily is a 10$k bill montly
 Is there any more affordable providers? How much of the cost can we save if:
- We increase the latency to 10-15s? Real-time is not important for us
- We Reduce the video resolution to super low ~ 240p? Our video frame is very small to  increase focus<p>2&#x2F; Build our own self-hosted server:
-  We are leaning towards open-source projects like LiveKit (seems better) and Jitsi. We plan to host the instances on AWS because of our CTO&#x27;s familiarity with its infrastructure.
Has anyone tried building B2C social apps with video calls from open-source projects like these? Could you share:
- How much does self-hosting on aws would save us?
- How deeply can we customize their UI? We don&#x27;t do anything like the usual video conferencing layout. We want to build our own layout which is vastly different.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
