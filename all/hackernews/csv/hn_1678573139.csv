35113256,Ask HN: Should I make my developer API product open source?,2023-03-11T22:04:10Z,satvikpendem,1,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;m building an API product for developers, it&#x27;s an abstraction over email and calendar providers so if you have an app that has to connect to a user&#x27;s email or calendar (perhaps a CRM to track and send emails with clients, schedule sales calls, etc), you don&#x27;t have to manually integrate with Gmail, Outlook and iCloud yourself, you integrate with my API and all you&#x27;d have to do is call `send_email(email_address)` and I&#x27;d handle the backend for talking to each provider.<p>Does it make sense to make such a developer API product open-source? I&#x27;ve seen some companies make their product open-source or open-core and even some turn their OSS into closed source after they get a few sales (this is what the largest competitor in the space had done, their API was fully open source until a few years ago, now they&#x27;re targeting enterprise mainly).<p>But then again there are lots of API companies that are wholly closed source and are pretty successful, like Bannerbear for example. So I&#x27;m not sure about the best method to move forward.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
