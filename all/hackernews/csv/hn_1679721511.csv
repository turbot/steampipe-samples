We are starting a new project next month. I was looking around to refresh myself on the current frameworks and looked into Hibernate the ORM framework. I remember using it in the past but the experience wasnt pleasant, felt very heavy and bloated, just to provide a mapping from a ResultSet to a custom application object. I looked at their docs today and I see that nothing much seems to have changed. In fact, reading these docs it appears that the framework has become even more bloated and complex. There&#x27;s also something called Hibernate Reactive which looking at examples, I don&#x27;t understand the use case for it.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m looking for inputs whether it&#x27;s just my lack of experience in this area in the past decade or has it really grown more complex and bloated.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35299676,Stripe's ACH Limits Are Idiotic – Need Help (or Pile On),2023-03-25T05:15:23Z,WolandTheCat,1,false,false,,,,,,"TLDR: does anyone know how to get Stripe to raise ACH transaction limits on your account?<p>I run a registered charity and our account is through Stripe. We accept donations from the public, which means that donors can set the price of their generous donations. I have had a Stripe account for 1.5 years and have so far processed hundreds of payments successfully.<p>However - I have had a total of 2 disputed charges. One was just a misunderstanding by a customer and that dispute was resolved in our favor. The other dispute we just lost (we don&#x27;t know why it was ever disputed). Both disputes were for donations of only $50.<p>We have many donors that try to give large donations via ACH because the transaction fees for ACH are much lower than cards. Makes sense. However, Stripe is refusing to raise our ACH limits (currently at $6k per ACH transaction and a total of $10k per week) because we have had 2 disputes. Even the dispute ruled in our favor counts as a strike against us! This is 100% a barrier to our philanthropic growth. And we are quite literally raising money for a registered 501(c)(3) charity!<p>I have repeatedly asked the Stripe support team to raise our ACH limits. They wont, and cite a (dumb as hell) rule where there needs to be a ratio of under 0.2% of your transactions (that number is 0.002) before your account can be eligible to raise the ACH limit. EVEN in cases where donors personally reach out to me, and I know them, and ask Stripe to make a 1 time exception to allow a larger ACH transaction for our CHARITY - they still deny it. EVEN when I offer up collateral just in case there is possibly a large disputed transaction in the future - they still deny the request. Frustrating is a gd understatement.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do and wanted to ask if anyone else in this community has been able to get around this. It&#x27;s crazy how if someone just wanted to ruin a charity&#x27;s ability to fundraise from large donors thru Stripe, they could just dispute a few of their small donations (theoretically). It sucks and is a bad rule. Thanks.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
