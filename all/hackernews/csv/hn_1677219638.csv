Here are seven seconds of a Joel Spolsky talk:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;0nbkaYsR94c?start=41&amp;end=48<p>1. Use the embed URL (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;ID) rather than the watch URL (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ID or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;ID)<p>2. Specify the start time, end time, or both, using the url parameters &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot;. The units are seconds. I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to use other units but it might be possible.<p>I’d run across mention of YouTube allowing one to link to a segment of a video using ?start=30&amp;end=60 (or in some cases &quot;stop&quot; rather than &quot;end&quot;) in various articles, but these parameters don’t work on the watch URL. When sharing a regular YouTube link, start=30 turns into t=30s and the stop or end parameter gets thrown out. I assumed YouTube had removed this useful functionality — but the docs for the embedded player (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;player_parameters?csw=1#end) still mentioned the end parameter, so I tried using them on the embed URL when not embedded, and it worked.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I wanted to understand how equity compensation really works. I come from an academic background and haven&#x27;t had much chance to look into the details of this.<p>One of the many questions I have in mind is the distinction between common stock and preferred stocks. And how do the absence&#x2F;presence of these specific types have an impact on the eventual payoff, if there is ever one?<p>Also, how can one negotiate around the eventual dilution of the equity as the startup raises more money?<p>Is there a guide that goes through these details? I also wonder whether this kind o equity can be used for investment in other assets such as real estate for instance.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
