Answer: &quot;you can&#x27;t use any GPU instances unless you start paying&quot;.<p>So it seems that Microsoft for Startups Azure users are second class citizens on Azure - asking to use a GPU instance, you are directed instead to sign up for a paid subscription.<p>I did have some AWS credits a year or two back, and I could use them for any service except buying domains, and I ran a number of very powerful GPU instances using those credits.<p>Seems like a &quot;bait and switch&quot; kind of thing, in which Microsoft for Startups waves its arms around alot, talking about supporting innovative startups, and then when you need to get some real work done on Azure, they tell you to go buy a paid plan.<p>What do you think of this?  Is it &quot;beggars can&#x27;t be choosers&quot;, or &quot;bait and switch&quot;?

fact checks have gotten metadata annotations in the form of schema.org ClaimReview,
which has allowed Google to incorporate claim reviews in their search results.<p>while this is a step forward, dubious articles get their traffic in various ways.
this made me wonder if it might be viable to build a database of ClaimReview data.
as these contain URLs to both article and their review, this could help make a reverse search.<p>in other words, given a url one could find corresponding fact checks.
this could then be incorporated into e.g. browser extensions or websites (think search engines, social media).
there was in fact a similar browser extension called Fact Layer, although it predated the ClaimReview standard, meaning it still lacked an effective way to populate it with the relevant data.<p>the bottleneck here then seems gathering such data.
now, CommonCrawl does annual crawls of the internet, and metadata is then extracted by WebDataCommons.
they&#x27;re not currently including ClaimReview in their separately extracted entities yet tho, while annual data also seems too slow for the purpose of combating current fake news.<p>only a limited number of websites seem to (structurally) publish ClaimReviews tho, meaning a manual list of such websites (e.g. based on those WebDataCommons found) might go a long way toward building such a dataset.<p>has there been any such an existing effort?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
