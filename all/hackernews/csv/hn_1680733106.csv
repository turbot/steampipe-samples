35460526,Show HN: Guesstimate – Generate a spreadsheet-like interface for any question,2023-04-05T21:21:00Z,adtac,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN, I built something to estimate things: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guesstimate.ai"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guesstimate.ai</a><p>Unlike ChatGPT, Guesstimate can do calculations. I asked both to calculate the time it&#x27;d take an object to fall from the ISS to sea level (about 400km, assume no air resistance). ChatGPT, using a lot of words, did everything correctly right until the last step [1]. Guesstimate took a similar approach, but it got the right answer: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guesstimate.ai&#x2F;e&#x2F;est114xrhnj1f6h9cm44"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guesstimate.ai&#x2F;e&#x2F;est114xrhnj1f6h9cm44</a><p>I think it&#x27;s absurd that we&#x27;re trying to teach LLMs basic arithmetic when there&#x27;s a literal arithmetic processing unit right next to the GPU. You wouldn&#x27;t ask a person to multiply two 5-digit numbers from just staring at the numbers; you&#x27;d give them a pen and paper. LLMs are great at chain of thought reasoning (CoT), and CPUs are great at memory and math, so why not take the best of both?<p>That&#x27;s how Guesstimate works. It generates CoT reasoning in Python, then parses the AST to build a computational graph. This way, you can play with the numbers right in the browser. For example, when estimating the cost of bread in 2050, if you don&#x27;t like Guesstimate&#x27;s assumed inflation rate, just change it. Kinda like a spreadsheet UI designed just for your question.<p>Teaching LLMs to use tools isn&#x27;t novel [2] [3], but it&#x27;s a relatively recent idea. I built this in a weekend so the demo will probably get formulas&#x2F;units wrong or totally break, but it generally seems to work. I&#x27;d like to get feedback on what works, what doesn&#x27;t and how to make it better.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;tDoeMqp.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;tDoeMqp.png</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2211.10435"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2211.10435</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2303.09014"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2303.09014</a>",story,https://guesstimate.ai,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

1. Think about which data connectors you need

3. Budget
4. Customer support SLAs<p>One tool may not meet all requirements or needs, but if it’s best-in-class at what it does, it’s worth it. Some helpful advice I’ve seen online:<p>Safeguard your raw data. Keep your raw data in a separate database within your data warehouse. Don’t give write access to this data to anyone; it should be strictly read-only. The raw data database is storage for all the data from various sources and serves as a backup in case data modeling leads to any issues such as deletions.<p>-- Vinesh
