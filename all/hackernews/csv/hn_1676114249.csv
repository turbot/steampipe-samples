I don&#x27;t know what I know, and as soon as I need something like, I google it. For example, it could be the 10th time I google &quot;efficient logging with Python&quot;. I may come across a link I already clicked, or not.<p>To me, it would be much more efficient to be able to search among all my external resources I already read and decided to keep, because it is limited to quality contents that I have already filtered, and that I already read, so that memory will activate when I read it another time.<p>At that point, you could tell me to use bookmarks. And it&#x27;s what I do. Then 6 months later, I end up with 200 bookmarks I will not sort. And even if they were sorted, I will be too slow to find something in them with no tagging, I and I would use Google anyway.<p>In a ideal world, It would be easy to save and tag external resources (one click from the browser), and then, browse and find them back easily.<p>Do you have this feeling too, or it&#x27;s just me? If so, what do you use for this?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
