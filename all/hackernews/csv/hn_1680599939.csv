However I want things that I can do on a personal level to protect myself and my family.<p>I have had a few thoughts:<p>1) AI is going to allow companies do do a lot more work with far fewer people. This means that companies will become a lot more profitable, and pass that value to shareholders. Actionable insight: Keep investing in the stock market, expecting significant returns.<p>2) AI improves worker output. Therefore I should adopt it as much as possible to make as much money while humans are still required to be in the loop.<p>3) If my job (computer programmer) becomes largely obsolete then I could move into a profession that is less susceptible to being replaced by AI.<p>4) Work on AI, this is good for the same reasons as #2<p>Can anyone see any problems with the above arguments, or even better propose some better ideas?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35436954,Ask HN: Do you use the ChatGPT or other LLMs to auto-generate unit test code?,2023-04-04T09:03:09Z,hu-beau,3,false,false,,,,,,"As developers, we understand the importance of unit testing in ensuring the functionality and reliability of our code. However, many of us dread implementing unit tests because of the time-consuming nature of the task. Moreover, generating effective test mock data requires a thorough understanding of the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the underlying business logic.<p>Enter ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) – these AI-driven tools have proven their ability to automatically generate various types of work, potentially including unit test code. By leveraging the capabilities of these AI models, we could significantly reduce the time and effort required for creating unit tests, thus increasing overall efficiency and code quality.<p>In light of these developments, I would like to open up a discussion on the following topics:<p>1. Have you had any experience using ChatGPT API or other LLMs to auto-generate unit test code? If so, what was the outcome and how effective was the generated code?<p>2. What challenges do you foresee when implementing AI-generated unit tests? Are there any potential drawbacks or limitations in using this approach?<p>3. Can AI-generated unit tests truly grasp the intricacies of PRDs and business logic to create accurate and relevant test mock data?<p>4 How do you think the adoption of AI-generated unit tests will impact the future of software development?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
