34758348,Show HN: G-Script – Visual Scripting for the Web,2023-02-12T01:11:38Z,llamaLord,3,false,false,2,[34758382],,,,"Hi all,
I&#x27;m a PM by day who taught themselves to code over COVID. One of the things I enjoyed during that process was learning how to make basic games in Unreal Engine using Blueprints. I found visual scripting was such an intuitive way to express what I call &quot;mid-tier complexity&quot; logic and I felt there really wasn&#x27;t a great equivalent for the web - so I built one over the last few months and this is my MVP.<p>Tools like Zapier etc are great and easy to use, but they&#x27;re heavily limited when it comes to expressing any kind of complex logic or trying to follow coding principles like DRY.<p>On the other end of the spectrum, serverless setups like Cloudflare workers or Firebase functions give you all the power of code, but there&#x27;s atleast 20-30 minutes of additional overhead involved in just getting the things live.<p>G-Script is designed to land exactly in the middle of these two options. It&#x27;s &quot;Lower level&quot; than tools like Zapier and supports most of the code-level primitives you NEED in order to express logic.<p>Examples being:
- Conditional Logic
- Loops
- Static Typing
- Objects &amp; Arrays
- Version Control
- Reusable logic&#x2F;functions<p>On the flip side, it&#x27;s much less friction that writing an actual serverless function, both up-front and ongoing.<p>Examples:
- You don&#x27;t need to know &quot;Code&quot;, just how to express your logic visually.
- No need to manage even basic deployments or use a CLI, it&#x27;s all done via a UI.
- Every Workflow is a seperate little microservice with it&#x27;s own URL that you can call via HTTP.
- The super simple version control system makes it easy to role back to earlier versions of a workflow if you break something, or make changes to your logic without impacting what executes and the Workflow URL until you&#x27;re ready to deploy your final iteration.",story,https://g-script.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
