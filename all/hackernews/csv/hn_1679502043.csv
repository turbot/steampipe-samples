It was even hard to see. Therefore, I created SwiftDeps(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swiftdeps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swiftdeps.com</a>) to make these tasks faster and easier and to improve work efficiency.
SwiftDeps is a MacOS application created to help you visualize your Swift Package or Xcode project as an interactive graph. It is well suited for building projects with a modular architecture. With such a visual graph, you can see the interdependencies between objects in your project or in a Swift package. In addition, the application also helps you check for new updates for the Swift packages you are using. Furthermore, Swiftdeps also identifies any issues in your project such as circular dependencies, orphaned packages, etc.",story,https://swiftdeps.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
