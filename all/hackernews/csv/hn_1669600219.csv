I’ve recently started a new role as a research software engineer for a neuroscience lab, after a few years in industry (still pretty junior) and I’m having trouble adjusting to the environment. From my understanding I’m the first software engineer brought on in ~2 years, and that has brought some friction. But beyond that, the habits and nature of researchers&#x2F;scientists&#x2F;academics is… well, odd to me, especially in comparison to a traditional software shop. I am quite fascinated by the research, and it is groundbreaking, so I intend to stay for some time, but I am still looking for guidance.<p>Has anyone gone through this transition, in particular as a relatively junior dev? Just looking for any thoughts or advice, that might help me make the best of a new role, and adapt to a research environment. Thanks.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
