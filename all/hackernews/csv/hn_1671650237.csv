Open to suggestions on what we should do, but here are a few initial questions we might explore:<p>* How has his publishing cadence evolved over time? It would be cool to create a timeline of all of his essays and overlay it with his tweets, public interviews, and videos to have a more complete picture of his thinking.
* Who are the most frequent reviewers? These are the people PG trusts most to review his work, so it might be interesting to see how this has evolved over time.
* How are the essays interconnected? PG frequently cross links between his essays and it could be interesting to illustrate this visually. Perhaps we can also explore which other sites cross link to PG&#x27;s essays as well.
* What are the key insights within each essay? Perhaps this can be distilled into principles, a la Ray Dalio.
* What are some of the best analogies in his essays? PG is a master of analogies. Maybe we can parse them out and highlight them in some cool way.<p>Experience building and searching data sets from HTML and Twitter, synthesizing text using ChatGPT, and visually displaying data could be particularly relevant.<p>If this sounds interesting to you, or even if you just have ideas, please fill out the form linked below.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;MGBczvuFZUnriDSJ9",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Still, hoping for some helpful background knowledge from HN about how these things typically work.<p>What happens, if, say, the startup is successful, and your equity has worth in the millions of dollars at the startups last valuation, but after your four year vest is up and you leave, the founders and board decide to issue new shares to themselves and all investors to dilute the value of your shares down to nothing? Seen in strictly financial terms, it seems to me that it would be in their interest to do so, aside from the hit to their reputation. And being no longer employed by the company, it seems to me that you wouldn&#x27;t have any leverage to prevent this by threatening to leave.<p>My best guess is that the situation works something like this: As a Key Shareholder (&gt;1%), you have to approve the issuance of new shares. However they can get around this, maybe by taking you to court for breach of contract, or by invoking some clause that otherwise allows them to bypass your right to be consulted to approve the issuance of new shares.<p>How does this typically work? Is it something that varies significantly by startup?

There was an adult there acting as the supervision, and the kids were working on getting their robot up and running for a demo.  One group was busy on the laptop&#x2F;joysticks. Another hand their hands on the robot, adjusting pieces of plexiglass that guided balls.  From a small demo moments earlier, I learned that the joysticks were VERY sensitive and drove multiple 300 watt motors that drove a chain drive for the wheels. The chain was exposed and there were fingers everywhere. I had a moment of pause and then I just yelled &quot;STOP&quot;, startling everyone including the supervisor who was mid-sentence in conversation with me. I slowly unwound the whole situation, turning it into a chat about &quot;culture of safety.&quot;<p>I think about this a lot, specifically because there was about 2 seconds where my brain thought, &quot;I&#x27;m not in charge here. I just met everyone. Do I really speak up? Maybe I&#x27;m missing something about all of this.&quot;  After many replays of this scenario over the years, I decided that I would rather embarrass myself horribly than hesitate next time.<p>Has anything like this happened to you? How did you feel? What did you learn?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

* Steam Decks are very fun to hack on
* Linux Consoles are good
* There are more knobs in systemd units than I remember
* Flatcar Linux is a thing that exists
* Remoting into a console is fun
* A&#x2F;B boots are less interesting than one might expect when you&#x27;re used to NixOS",story,https://determinate.systems/posts/nix-on-the-steam-deck,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
