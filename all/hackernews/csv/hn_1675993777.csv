34734207,Slash will transform the way companies receive cryptocurrency payments in 2023,2023-02-10T01:03:24Z,slashweb3,2,false,false,1,[34734397],,,,"Slash Fintech Ltd., led by CEO Shinsuke Sato, released Slash web3 payments(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slash.fi&#x2F;) last August in the year 2022, in an attempt to improve the current state of decentralised crypto payments worldwide by providing seamless settlements and a sophisticated UX for the payments flow.<p>Slash Web3 Payments creates the possibility for cryptocurrency holders to pay for their everyday purchases directly, with almost any tokens they want, as long as those tokens possesses sufficient liquidity.<p>For merchants or shops, this means that they are no longer limited to receiving specific and often a reduced selection of cryptocurrencies and tokens as payment in their online or offline stores.<p>The Slash initiative can already support more tokens than many of the crypto payments alternatives currently found in the market. Slash Web3 Payments supports more than 1400 tokens from at least 6 different protocols, and is constantly expanding to increase those options. Another key difference is that Slash does not charge their merchants any installation fees or transaction fees. Instead, a percentage from the slippage is taken.<p>As an example, in order to pay for a transaction in USDC, payers are not restricted to paying with existing USDC tokens in their wallet. They can choose from their own available tokens, such as, perhaps, MATIC. Slash will compare and select the best on time rate from decentralised exchanges and do the conversion automatically.<p>It is required to have a Metamask wallet or any of the Walletconnect supported alternatives. After clicking the generated payment link or scanning the QR, the payers will see the amount and will have the possibility to choose from their own available tokens the currency that they want to pay with.<p>Slash is working actively to increase its customers and partners primarily in Japan but also, in other regions across the globe such as: LATAM, USA, Canada, EU, Africa, and Asia.<p>Among the current targets, Slash is appealing mainly to restaurants, retail &amp; e-commerce (fashion, travel), luxury, multi-payments providers, among other industries.<p>The startup raised 1.5 Million USD last year in a seed funding round from MZWeb3Fund and several private investors. It is currently raising a Series A. This will help with Slash’s efforts to become one of the global leaders in cryptocurrency payments.<p>If you want to learn more about Slash, have any questions, comment, or wish to send collaboration requests, please contact the team directly at discord Slash Web3 Payments (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;gjjmvUar)<p>Or, follow their online presence:<p>Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slash.fi&#x2F;<p>Twitter: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SlashWeb3<p>Medium: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@SlashWeb3",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34734479,Tell HN: I'm on a cross-continent flight using AR glasses,2023-02-10T01:36:02Z,remh,1,false,false,,,,,,"A few weeks ago I got my hands on a pair of AR glasses after reading about them here on HN, the ones that are like sunglasses with a semi-transparent LED screen. They promise to be a big screen experience on-the-go.<p>So, I gave them a shot at home first and they actually exceeded my expectations. But, let&#x27;s be real, but it felt like a gimmick in a home office environment.<p>But, my cross-continent flight was the perfect opportunity to put these babies to the test. I brought my trusty wireless keyboard and mouse along for the ride and here&#x27;s what I found:<p>The Good:<p>- If you&#x27;re like me and used to working on monitors, these glasses are definitely a step up from using a laptop while traveling.
- There&#x27;s definitely some potential in this technology.<p>The Not-So-Good:<p>- The display quality is just okay, nothing too impressive and led to eye fatigue only after a few minutes.
- The lack of head tracking can be a bit disorienting.
- The wires and keyboard&#x2F;mouse setup isn&#x27;t exactly sleek. A wireless option will be needed.<p>All in all, I think the technology still has a ways to go but in the next few years, it could really mature and open up some cool new opportunities.<p>Going to put them down now as my eyes are hurting though.<p>Is anyone using those on a day to day basis?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
