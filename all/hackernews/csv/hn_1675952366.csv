At first, our employees were a bit resistant to the idea, thinking it was a bit old school. But, we gave it a try anyway. Three months in and we haven&#x27;t seen any major improvements in our product or processes, and it seems like our team is still dragging their feet when it comes to using the tracking system. Some are even underreporting the amount of time they&#x27;re putting in.<p>I was curious, have you had any experience with time tracking solutions in a startup environment? Have you seen any positive results from its implementation? We&#x27;re starting to wonder if it&#x27;s worth continuing to use time tracking or if we should be looking for other ways to optimize. And if you do think it&#x27;s worth it, any suggestions on how we can get our team on board and get more accurate data? Thanks in advance!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We plan to make money from the cloud version and a future enterprise edition with advanced features - maybe advanced roles and permissions.<p>The current version includes a visual designer for automation flows which can run on schedules (Cron), by Webhooks, or by triggers from external apps—25 apps and counting, including Stripe, Calendly, Google Sheets and others (we’re building these rapidly).<p>The app is customizable, you can add custom steps using HTTP requests or you can write Node.js code and bring in your npm packages.<p>If you’re curious about how it works, here are the docs: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activepieces.com&#x2F;docs"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activepieces.com&#x2F;docs</a><p>We’d love to hear HN’s thoughts on what we’re building!<p>Thanks.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
