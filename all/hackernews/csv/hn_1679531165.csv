35268796,Ask HN: What would you use Twitter's Birdwatch (a.k.a. Community Notes) for?,2023-03-23T00:02:25Z,camurban,1,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;ve found the usefulness of Twitter&#x27;s Birdwatch (aka Community Notes), which takes a community approach to annotate and contextualize misleading tweets, super compelling. It seems like a good way for Twitter to enable free speech while addressing consequential bias and misinformation.<p>From Twitter: &quot;Birdwatch works by using bridging-based ranking. Rather than majority rules, or popularity, Birdwatch shows notes that are found helpful by people who tend to disagree (in their Birdwatch ratings). This increases the odds that context added to Tweets is helpful to wide audiences.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m curious... what are some other important use cases outside Twitter that would benefit from a Birdwatch-like solution using bridging-based ranking?<p>More on Birdwatch: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communitynotes.twitter.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;en",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Does a loop always need something called `step`? Does it do something different if there is an `i` instead of `step` in some different example?<p>I find it hard to give really good examples, because now I immediately recognize where a variable is declared, which objects are just standard like `console` or what&#x27;s a property with a standardized name like `array.length`, but I know for sure, that this was a significant cognitive load for me when I was starting out.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Guide&#x2F;Loops_and_iteration",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
