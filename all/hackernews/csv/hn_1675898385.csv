(People looked at me like the flying monkeys were gonna arrive at any moment, but with a little whistling we got past the graveyard.) The attacker has a geometric advantage. Emotionally thinking that you&#x27;re gonna increase your SYNACKs for good is a fool&#x27;s errand that only hurts you and some anonymous victim: you have to &#x2F;geometrically&#x2F; increase it to offset the attacker. Thinking this way is the usual outcome of moral hazard.<p>Moral hazard for good is embracing hostility and reducing SYNACK retries to something like 2... if not 1... and assuming that somebody who really wants to connect will selfishly up their initial SYN attempts correspondingly. So the sender is prepared to send up to 4 SYNs losing 2 to attrition (and if they send them all at once without backing off or waiting for responses then they&#x27;re jackasses and should be dealt with accordingly), and the SYNACK sender sends 2 losing 1 to attrition and the result is the same. So sad for that client having to send 4 SYNs instead of 2, my heart is breaking at the cruelty of teh netz!<p>It&#x27;s that simple: moral hazard can be a force for good and you owe teh netz nothing. There&#x27;s no mathematical reason to spread the risk around; all it does in practice in the face of an adversary is to cause more damage and spread that around.<p>If there is a question lurking here, it&#x27;s whether tcp_synack_retries is for each SYN successfully received or whether it&#x27;s for the connection. If I find some free time maybe I&#x27;ll set up a VM and use Scapy to fire some SYNs at it.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
