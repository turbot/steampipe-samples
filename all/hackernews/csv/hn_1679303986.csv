There are some rules that only apply to certain types of controllers, such as GDPR article 6(e), which is only applicable to public bodies. These differences do not entail that public bodies have fewer obligations under the GDPR, than private companies.<p>Does anyone have any links to articles, arguments that Governmental organizations have less of an obligation than NGOs?
