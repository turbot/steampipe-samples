35178720,Can Someone Ask ChatGPT4 If This Free Energy Idea Is Feasible,2023-03-16T06:10:32Z,patientplatypus,1,false,false,1,[35178760],,,,"I have this idea on how we can develop free energy and I&#x27;d like to know if it would be feasible, and how much it would cost in total. I think chatGPT4 can solve the problem, but I don&#x27;t have the money for the program. Below is the idea - can someone put it into chatGPT4 and see what it says? Thanks.<p>The idea.<p>From a note I sent to another person<p>I would like us to have free energy though. I think that perhaps the point of life is to make the necessities of life so cheap as to be free so we can all sit around thinking deep thoughts and staring at the clouds. If you have any pull with the NRC I might mention (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nuscalepower.com&#x2F;en), base grid load capacity (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energyeducation.ca&#x2F;encyclopedia&#x2F;Baseload_power), this (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archy.deberker.com&#x2F;the-uk-is-wasting-a-lot-of-wind-p...), and Djikstra&#x27;s algorithm.<p>In essence, each small scale passive power plant reactor, if optimally placed along the power grid, would produce much higher returns of energy to the grid than just their energy production rating.<p>You can also make nuclear power plants shippable around the world by putting small charges around the core that would fragment the radioactive material and release a mixture of boron and concrete if the containment unit is opened. Which means that third world countries could have energy independence. The geometries and physics involved is a minor engineering problem, as opposed to fusion reactors that require theoretical physics.<p>I&#x27;d like to know approximately how much this would cost and how long it would take. Thanks again!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

If everyone can install and run your program locally, why would anyone pay you for it? On the other hand, if you didn&#x27;t make your program open source, how do you get around the problem of people cracking and distributing it for free?<p>Many years later I&#x27;ve finally started to enter the software industry after all. About a week ago the thought &quot;SaaS is just DRM done right&quot; floated through my brain, and the more I think about it, the more true it feels. Code running on someone else&#x27;s secured server, with someone else&#x27;s data and APIs and integrations, and requiring modern authentication-authorization loops, just <i>feels</i> miles harder to crack compared to some Proprietary.exe asking for a license key.<p>The analogy is very loose but it feels accurate in an economic sense to me.
