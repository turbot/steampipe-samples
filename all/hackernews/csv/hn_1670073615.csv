33843033,Ask HN: Why don't you like Dart?,2022-12-03T12:39:50Z,account-5,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Earlier this year I was looking for a language that was truly cross platform: mobile, desktop, web; across all the major OS&#x27;s. I was put off by hybrid apps due to (from the outside in) complexity and the huge amount of frameworks; which ones to use? What one is the best?<p>This is when I became aware of Dart and Flutter. To me it seemed like a no brainer. Truly cross platform with JIT and AOT compilation. Hot reload for development. Just to name a few things.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve come to realise that whilst Flutter gets a lot of love, Dart is mostly universally dismissed or disliked. In a recent Show HN post [0] about replacing Dart with Closure for Flutter programming I replied to another comment, dismissive of Dart, asking what was so back about Dart [1], this lead to some good discussion about its pros and cons. There&#x27;s appears to be a push to replace Dart with multiple other languages in relation to Flutter. So, again, what&#x27;s so bad about Dart?<p>I thought a dedicated discussion would be good so more people could voice their opinions.<p>I&#x27;m not a full time developer, or what I would consider a developer at all. I just create personal project apps. For me Dart&#x2F;Flutter is a good work horse for least amount of work most amount of benefit.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33820608<p>[1]
