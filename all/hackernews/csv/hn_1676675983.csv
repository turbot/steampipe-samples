I&#x27;d like to present our data analytics tool for creators. Understanding data is so important for creators and musicians but making sense of it can be really difficult and time consuming to do, so we wanted to make something better. Something simple and purpose-built.<p>The idea is simple: Connect the data sources used by musicians and creators (Eventbrite, Shopify, etc) into our tool, then ask questions using natural language in a  Q&amp;A interface to pull up answers to complex questions like &quot;How many of my fans are based in LA and haven&#x27;t bought merchandise from me yet?&quot;<p>We&#x27;re still very early on and we&#x27;re focusing on getting feedback from creators, musicians, and anyone who could benefit from a &quot;simpler&quot; data tool.
