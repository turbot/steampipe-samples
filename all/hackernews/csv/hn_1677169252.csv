The impacts are continuing to get more severe and our governments can&#x27;t meet their own targets. Separate from me making climate-conscious choices (which frankly I believe has little impact), perhaps the bigger leverage decision is where we choose to relocate our family.<p>I asked myself what will the planet look like 50+ years from now, and could there be &quot;goldilocks zones&quot; where the climate there will be stable for many years to come. Ideally this isn&#x27;t an area where I need to personally live off the land, but instead large cities&#x2F;communities that are protected. Separately, it may make for a good investment as well, but my primary focus is where to raise our family for the years to come.<p>Has anyone else been thinking about this problem or put some work into it? I took a stab at it some months ago, trying to piece together different climate projections of the future across factors that I felt captured the greatest risks (heat, wildfire, drought, flooding, etc.) I attempted combine these risks into a single score&#x2F;grade and then map this grade across the continental USA. Here&#x27;s what it looks like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1gTIoXDtlYWEx4xhFIs9CIkaFX9i3vbjB&#x2F;view?usp=share_link and here&#x27;s it as an interactive tool https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lucidhome.co<p>What surprised me is how much more protected northern USA is over the south. However, I also found there to be &quot;pockets&quot; (e.g. in central USA) where it&#x27;s a low-risk area shield around high-risk regions.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to further discuss this line of thinking with people here, and share findings with each other.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I have been on-and-off stimulants for the last decade but recently quit cold turkey because I got sick and tired of dealing with all of the availability issues. I also hate being so dependent&#x2F;reliant on psychiatrists who in my experience don&#x27;t really give a shit about you or your wellbeing. I hated needing to ask for refills every 30 days, hoping that they would respond in a timely manner and that the stars would align so there was no interruption.<p>That being said, my life has almost come grinding to a halt. It has been 3 months and I am still struggling to get back to a decent baseline. I am beginning to wonder if it is possible to live life without them, which is an additional strain on my emotions.<p>Has anyone here gone down a similar path to treat this in their own way without schedule I controlled substances?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

There is also a rudeimntary voting system and the homepage is sorted by highest rated.<p>But the most exciting bit is I added my own custom fine tuned model to it last night that I&#x27;m calling &quot;Psychedelia&quot;. All of the top images one the homepage are using this model.<p>It seems to work best with basic prompts and I often still get artifacts like double heads, but I&#x27;m quite happy with the initial results and will continue to fine tune.<p>The site is built with NextJS, TailwindCSS and Supabase and you can login and generate images for free.<p>Hope you enjoy!<p>Thanks,

Had any of you succeeded in using value qualifiers for landing an interview? Put simply, do they work?<p>What is a Value Qualifier? A Value Qualifier is a proposed solution for a key problem that the company is facing delivered to the hiring managers to showcase applicants’ skills to qualify for the role regardless of background and seniority. Aka your ticket to skip the line. Usually particularly adopted by people who are trying a career switch or have just started their first job search. I learned the term on LinkedIn from Andrew Bowker, despite the brand new terminology the concept isn’t new.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
