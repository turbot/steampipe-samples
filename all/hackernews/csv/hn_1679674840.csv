Bing AI, for instance, can scrape live content and present it directly in search results, effectively bypassing the website altogether.<p>So, does this mean content marketing is dead?

35291305,Show HN: Mortgage Chat – A bot that answers your awkward home buying questions,2023-03-24T16:19:29Z,roseway4,1,false,false,,,,,,"Mortgage Chat is a GPT-3.5-powered chatbot that answers your mortgage lending and home buying questions you were too afraid to ask.<p>Working with mortgage loan officers can be challenging, off-putting, and frustrating.<p>My goals for this project were:
- Familiarizing myself with in-context learning using GPT3
- Exploring AI&#x27;s potential in complex domains (non-technology) domains like mortgage lending
- Creating a user-friendly, non-judgmental, and non-commercially motivated tool for 24x7 guidance on anything mortgage-related<p>How I built it:
- I built the bot using Langchain and used their sample chatbot as a base, although did significant prompt and other tweakings, including building the &quot;next questions to ask&quot; functionality. 
- I crawled the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau&#x27;s website for mortgage content. Relevant content is fed to the bot from a FAISS index (Langchain makes this super easy). I used the CFPB as it struck me as the most neutral and factual of various online content sources.
- I also provide the bot with up-to-date mortgage rate data from the Federal Reserve&#x27;s FRED service.<p>The bot could definitely be improved:
- I tried letting GPT3 ask the user questions about their mortgage situation in order to be more helpful but found it overly aggressive and off-putting. I think this is definitely feasible, but requires more thought.
- Websockets can be a pain, and I&#x27;d probably want to use server-side events in production to stream results to the bot client.<p>h&#x2F;t to:
- Langchain and community.

35291015,"Show HN: Open-source, privacy-focused developer tools (early stages)",2023-03-24T16:03:49Z,dmkirwan,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN!<p>Many developers use websites to handle menial everyday tasks like formatting json, generating uuid&#x27;s, etc. The problem that we found with this is that many of these websites send our data to the server to process it. This didn&#x27;t sit very well with us, considering it could contain customer&#x27;s information, so we decided to build these tools internally and open source them. For most cases, this processing can be done on the client side without any need for the data to leave your browser.<p>In the spirit of being privacy-focused, we don&#x27;t track usage levels of this and we certainly don&#x27;t send any data to a backend service.<p>As I mentioned in the title, this project is in the early stages at the moment but we wanted to share it to get feedback and see if people find it useful. If you do have feedback, let me know in the comments here or feel free to add an issue to the GitHub repository: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DevScreenInternal&#x2F;ds-devtools"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DevScreenInternal&#x2F;ds-devtools</a>.",story,https://devtools.devscreen.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
