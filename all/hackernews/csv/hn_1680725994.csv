I&#x27;m pretty skinny (6 feet tall, 150 lbs) and I don&#x27;t have any family history of type 2 diabetes (besides my grandmother who developed it in her late 80s).<p>My current theory is that I have insulin resistance due to my sedentary programmer&#x27;s lifestyle (i.e. sitting in front of computer 8 hours per day).<p>I&#x27;ve cut all cereal, bread, rice, pasta, soda, and processed sweets from my diet and switched to low GI foods like lentils and yogurt as my main carbs. I&#x27;ve also started walking every day for 30 minutes, but it barely moved the needle 6 months later (a1c of 6.0). I have not tried going pure keto because it sounds onerous but I might.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating because most advice online around prediabetes and type 2 diabetes assumes the patient is overweight or obese and that they need to lose a significant % of body weight (which would be difficult&#x2F;impossible for me). Anyone else out there has this issue? I know everyone is different, but just want to see if anyone else had this same issue and discovered any &quot;hacks&quot; or insights into this disease.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
