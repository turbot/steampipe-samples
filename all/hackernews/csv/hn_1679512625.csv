Essense.io<p>Short pitch: Analyze user feedback with AI to generate actionable insights.<p>Longer Pitch:<p>Have you ever wanted to analyze your own product or that of a competitors&#x27; to figure out what the product is doing right? (and more importantly, what it&#x27;s doing wrong?).<p>With a few clicks you can figure out what users love and hate most about a product based on reviews posted to the Appstore, Playstore, Trustpilot, and more!<p>You can also import your tickets from HubSpot or custom client transcripts to run the analysis against it.<p>Notes:<p>- Some folks may feel uncomfortable sharing private data (HubSpot tickets, Transcripts, etc...) with Open AI, totally get it. I&#x27;m working on fine tuning a llama model to extract insights so i don&#x27;t have to send anything over but for an initial launch it seems to work well. For existing publicly available reviews (Appstore, Playstore, Trustpilot, etc...) there should be no worries there.<p>- Adding G2 and Capterra soon, happy to take any suggestions for other sites to fetch reviews from.<p>Fun fact: Best apps i&#x27;ve found to test for NEGATIVE reviews have been dating apps, boy does Tinder have some hate reviews.<p>Happy to hear any and all feedback, positive or negative.",story,https://www.essense.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
