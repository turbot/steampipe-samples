Plus, I can jot down quick notes on each task as I go, making it easier to document everything once I’m finished.<p>This tool is really simple with only 5 commands - tsr, tsn, tsl, tsv, tse<p>tsr writes a new record<p>tsn writes a new note<p>tsl shows you the current task<p>tsv builds a static html page displaying a single timeline of the tasks and notes<p>tse opens the directory where records are stored for easy manual editing<p>TSR stores your data as simple csv files in ~&#x2F;tsr, making it super easy to integrate with other tools or perform your own custom analysis and visualisation magic. The built-in tsv timeline visualisation is rather simple and doesn’t do any analysis (for now at least).<p>It depends solely on Python3 and works offline.
