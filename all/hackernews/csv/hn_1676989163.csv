34881401,Show HN: Flasho (YC W20) -Open source tool to set up transactional notifications,2023-02-21T14:16:04Z,jhansie,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN,<p>We just launched Flasho- an open-source tool to set up transactional notifications in minutes.<p>Last year when we were building an avatar-based social app, we realised that building notifications took up significant time and development effort (establishing microservices, integrating with a bunch of different service providers etc). And every time we wanted to set up new notifications or make changes to existing ones, we had to make multiple changes across the codebase which was time-consuming and messy. We realised we needed a better way to manage this.<p>Existing solutions were either too expensive or required us to share customer data with third parties. And that is when we decided to build an in-house tool. This tool turned out to be incredibly useful for us. It was a single dashboard to create and manage all our customer notifications across channels. It saved us weeks of developer bandwidth and we could now create and manage notifications with little to no code. We decided to open source this tool and thus Flasho was born.<p>Flasho is self-hosted(docker&#x2F;deploy from source). You can just connect your DB, set up event triggers and conditions, create content and connect to the service providers of your choice in a matter of minutes, without writing any code.<p>We have SMS and email notifications now. We plan on adding in-app and push soon. We have currently built it for PostgreSQL. We will make it compatible with more databases in the coming days.<p>We’ve launched it under the MIT licence so any developer can use the tool. We don&#x27;t intend on charging individual developers. The plan is to generate revenue through a cloud hosted service, priority support, features like multi-user login etc.<p>Check it out and let us know what you think!",story,https://github.com/flashohq/flasho,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
34880957,Tell HN: Microsoft Teams no longer supports pasting Markdown links,2023-02-21T13:37:57Z,LorenDB,2,false,false,,,,,,"Microsoft Teams has had a subset of Markdown implemented for a while (although it wasn&#x27;t a completely conformant implementation; single asterisks around text <i>like this</i> produces bold text instead of italics, while _underscores_ do produce italics). However, I have discovered, to my deep disappointment, that Teams no longer will properly handle Markdown links.<p>EDIT: I just realized that this only applies to copy-pasted links. This is really bad, though: Most people <i>only</i> copy-paste URLs; typing a URL by hand is uncommon. Anyway, back to past me:<p>I don&#x27;t know if any Microsoft Teams developers lurk here, but if you do, could you please try to get Markdown support back to Commonmark compliance? I&#x27;d love to get a truly compliant Markdown entry, even if it was hidden behind a setting. At the very least though, links should be fixed.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I suppose I’d be perfectly fine with an 80k starting salary, but feel like I’d want&#x2F;need to look into other income streams.<p>Plus, I was pretty disappointed to find out that a lot of mech e jobs with hands on experience are apparently rare; however, feel like I could easily rely on some hobby spaces to cure my want for hands on projects.<p>On the other hand, with my deep love for computers and software it feels like comp sci could be a good fit. I’ve always loved tinkering with any sort of code. For example, whether it be simply editing HTML or CSS code for a website to play around with the changes or heavily custom modifying stock iOS (and playing around with root access) on my jailbroken iPhone. However though, I still have yet to really write a handful of programs.<p>So after finding out about how much SWE salaries are and the higher pay ceiling, I was definitely excited to look into it more. Feels like I’d be choosing it mainly for better pay, benefits, and working conditions. Plus, the thought of remote work seems really appealing.<p>I do love the statement about how one doesn’t need to feel like that aren’t able to switch carrier paths ever. Though I really don’t have the desire to plan on spending the time put towards a partial career in mech e and then eventually switch to SWE down the road.<p>I certainly already think more spatially, physically, and mechanically, than I do algorithmically so feels like I truly just have to listen to my heart and go with mech e, but at least explore comp sci even more during my spare time. I’m thinking at least a major in mech e and a possible minor in comp sci.<p>Any thoughts or experience on the topic would greatly be appreciated.
