I&#x27;m a developer for a long time, and I normally work across multiple repos at my day job. My breaking point came when I worked on a modular application with 20+ repositories, a feature would often span multiple repos, and getting a good overview was difficult. Not to mention navigating across apps, terminal paths, and generally getting everything to work together.<p>Naturally, I wrote scripts to manage the complexity. And eventually I built a little menu bar application to do those things. DevControls is my attempt to bring the core features I use daily into a nice little package.<p>I&#x27;ve been using this myself for some months at this point, it&#x27;s stable and I have all core functionality in the app. So I figured I should send it out to the world and see if it sticks. My next planned features that I miss from my prototypes are: seeing a list of open PRs, checking out branches, stash + checkout master + pull from origin (all in one go), pulling all repos in one go, and honestly a few more things<p>--<p>Happy to receive any feedback!",story,https://jontelang.com/DevControls/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Location Finder calculates the most optimal location for everyone on the team to come together.<p>The flight algorithm takes into account the following criteria:
1. Average travel time per person (the most critical factor)
2. Average number of layovers per person
3. Estimated flight costs
4. CO2 footprint<p>This tool is based on Kiwi.com API, which searches flight connections from more than 500 airlines. It acts as an ‘advisor’ and is not a booking tool to help you find the optimal locations.<p>Try this example:
- Type in 5 people flying from Berlin, 12 people from London, 14 people from New York and see where it suggests you meet.<p>We look forward to hearing your feedback.<p>What&#x27;s new&#x2F;improved:
- Now you can search using both city and airport names
- We now evaluate results from the CO2 perspective and recommend the option with the lowest CO2 footprint (usually when part of the team does not fly)
- Better search suggestions; the tool now recognizes that Prague and Praha are the same thing, and you can use special characters like the city Košice
- We have added state information for US cities; for instance, typing &quot;Portland&quot; will now show options: Portland, OR or Portland, ME.
- Previously, we only showed search results for departures from now + 10 days. We have now updated this to now + 30 days, which better reflects people planning team retreats.
- We have fixed bugs and optimized the database for faster results.",story,https://www.surfoffice.com/location-finder,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
