This is a 3-part article and links to the other parts are available therein. It gives a nice overview of UPI as implemented by NCPI in India.<p>My question is what constitutes a settlement failure?

But I&#x27;d like to understand settlements is a problem first, before I understand how CDBC will help with settlements.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
