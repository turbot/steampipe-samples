&quot;const blob = new Blob([html], {type: &#x27;text&#x2F;html&#x27;});&quot; so it&#x27;s super easy actually but I couldn&#x27;t find a plugin that handles it nicely like a copy paste response as HTML button.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35449873,Apple Scammed Me,2023-04-05T05:52:03Z,opzz,1,false,false,,,,,,A couple of weeks ago I found what I considered to be a low level vulnerability in iMessage. You could clobber an iMessage that had been sent to you with your own custom message. There were no visual effects and it withstood context switches at the very least. I was modifying real memory in iMessage FROM THEIR GUI. In apple&#x27;s defense I never bothered to hunt down how severe of a problem this was (ie was i overflowing a buffer or was the write controlled?). Regardless they at first struggled to reproduce the exploit. It got to a point where I had to generate a sysdiagnose for them. This was 8 days ago. They immediately patched it in Ventura 13.3 without a word about it or any credit for me. I&#x27;m younger (if you couldn&#x27;t tell from my profile) and it would&#x27;ve meant a lot to me career wise as I work in RE&#x2F;VR. I&#x27;ve seen much less severe things get designated CVEs.,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
