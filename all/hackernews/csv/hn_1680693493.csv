I informed the company&#x27;s P&amp;C, but they didn&#x27;t take my complaint seriously. Since the company is under the influence of managers and extreme groupism, I couldn&#x27;t do much about it legally, especially since they refused to provide me with a termination letter.<p>I had been working with the company for over 5 years and 8 months, and I had never had any issues with previous managers. However, I had multiple arguments with my current manager over the past two months due to expectations to work on weekends.<p>The P&amp;C decided to early release me, but they defamed me in an internal email sent to all employees working currently, which has greatly impacted my mental state. I&#x27;m afraid to post anything on LinkedIn until I receive my experience letter, but my past co-workers have been vocal about the incident in Linkedin.<p>I only didn&#x27;t inform my acting manager about my migraine, but I told my co-workers about it on the same day. I feel devastated by the whole ordeal, as this company was my first job after graduation, and I had been a loyal employee with consistent growth and promotion over these 5 years.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
