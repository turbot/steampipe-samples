33741020,Show HN: I built an AI-powered search engine for a fashion and homeware store,2022-11-25T10:22:05Z,wasimlorgat,2,false,false,1,[33741241],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I built Meepo – a smarter search engine for a local (South African) fashion and homeware store.<p>I have no affiliation with said store. I built this for myself, because I was frustrated at how difficult it was to find what I wanted with the existing search engine + I was curious how well CLIP (a relatively new AI technique with open source code and models) would work here.<p>I think it works quite well! It&#x27;s much more forgiving than the original search engine. I don&#x27;t have to guess what exactly they decided to label a particular item. But what I like even more is that it works quite well for abstract things like &quot;colourful shoes&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the full stack:<p>- Hardware: Deployed on a 2CPU 4GB RAM VPS w&#x2F; docker<p>- Storage: SQLite + object storage (for images)<p>- Search: CLIP text&#x2F;image neural networks + faiss similarity search index<p>- Pipeline: Python scripts + cron<p>- Web: Django serving HTML&#x2F;Tailwind&#x2F;daisyUI<p>- IDE: Developed in notebooks w&#x2F; nbdev (I&#x27;m trying to develop all of my software in Jupyter notebooks - a separate discussion)<p>I tried to keep the implementation as simple as possible and I&#x27;m happy with the result! It took ~2 weeks to build and has been running seamlessly without my input for a few weeks now. I&#x27;m more familiar with ML than web so very happy with that timeline.",story,https://meepo.shop/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
