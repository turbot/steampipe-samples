Management, junior coders, website developers, database architect, devops, who will be replaced in a couple of years by AI?<p>If GPT is already capable of performing as a &quot;very eager junior programmer&quot;, in a few months who is going to hire any junior coder to perform task, if GPT is doing that for me? How many months are left before we will &quot;open the benefits of programming to new audiences&quot;?<p>I&#x27;ve invested my time and effort to gain a large quantity of knowledge that will be replaced by generated code. All my effort to create a career or my dreams of creating new technologies and services are fading since coding soon will no more be an ability but a matter of prompting to an AI.<p>I know that some of you are thinking that the AI will open so many possibilities of building, but for who? An AGI or an assistance is a way of centralizing information access, not expanding it. Users will access and perform things with the assistance and nothing else. So what are we going to build, plugins for the AI?<p>I&#x27;ve never felt such a low hope for the future of IT and for my future.<p>reference:
