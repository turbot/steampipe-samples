As such so is your environment. Pair that with the a fickle human mind and you get something where you may know what you want <i>now</i> but not what you want over a longer period of time. The fickleness of mind  together with randomness of ones environment leads to wanting&#x2F;desiring different things at different times. So while one <i>may</i> know what they want now they may not be able to get a handle on a deeper pattern of what they want or the general types of things they gravitate to. There is very hard to know what you want (over a long period of time (which is what is often implied in the question what do you want))<p>If that hypothesis needs to be validated or nullified then it’s seems like meticulous journaling of what you want now and it’s why etc.  would be one way to collect a record of those things. Over time with enough collection and review of the journal one may be able to see atleast a pattern of the types of things they want&#x2F; gravitate to. That’s the worse case scenario. The best case is you get immediate clarity on what you want.<p>This approach could help in understanding what one wants for their current phase in life (5&#x2F;10 year) and not necessarily what they want for the rest of their life- even still it gives a great directional answers.<p>Finally it may be impossible (for the avg human) to know what they want for the rest of the life given we change as a person over time. You are not the same person you where 10 years ago. So there is a high probability that what you want now is different from what you wanted 10 years ago.,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
