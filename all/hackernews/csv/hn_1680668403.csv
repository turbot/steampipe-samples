35449254,We need better air quality exposure monitoring,2023-04-05T04:17:29Z,LucGhislain,1,false,false,,,,,,"Existing air quality metrics - AQI, PM2.5 - measure only the particle size and there is no information on composition.  PM 2.5 could be salt spray, pesticide aerosol, or particles with toxic metals -- there is no way to tell the difference based only on size.  Data on composition is essential to determine the health impact.<p>Exposome: DNA sequencing technologies have accelerated research. However, genetics has been found to be the root cause for only about 15% of diseases, with the balance due to environmental exposures and interactions between genes and the environment. There has not been much progress in the collection of exposure data in the past hundred years.  We still rely on dietary surveys and coarse geographic sampling at the level of zipcode.  To determine root cause and eventually prevent disease, we need better environmental exposure monitoring.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
