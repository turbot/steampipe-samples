34944965,Show HN: Vaero – Build fast log pipelines in Python,2023-02-26T12:19:54Z,blee37,1,false,false,,,,,,"We’ve spent the last few months building Vaero and are now sharing the beta for community feedback: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vaerohq&#x2F;vaero"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vaerohq&#x2F;vaero</a>.<p>Vaero is the first log shipper for developers to write log pipelines with code. You write pipelines in Python, and the pipelines are converted into task graphs that run super fast in Go.<p>Why we built this:
- Current log shippers like Fluentd, Logstash, and Vector.dev only let you specify log pipelines with config files (YAML, JSON, TOML) or domain specific languages (VRL)
- This works for simple pipelines but is unwieldy for even mildly complex use cases
- It’s annoying for someone on the team to have to learn the specific config file format or DSL of the tool
- You can’t use the code-based development tools you’re used to, like IDEs, version control, git, and so on<p>Our beta version lets you:
- Write log pipelines in Python using a Spark-like syntax
- Pipelines run blazing fast in Go
- Native integrations to collect from log sources like HTTP, Okta, and more and write to destinations like S3
- Built-in transformation functions to reshape and normalize log data
- Single binary running on a Docker
- Open source<p>We’d love to hear your feedback and opinions. Feel free to try us out for free - and if there’s a specific integration you want, let us know.<p>Github: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vaerohq&#x2F;vaero"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vaerohq&#x2F;vaero</a>",story,https://github.com/vaerohq/vaero,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34944885,Ask HN: Please critique my metalanguage: “Dogma”,2023-02-26T12:02:04Z,kstenerud,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN!<p>Dogma (formerly KBNF) is a modernized metalanguage with better expressiveness and binary support, focusing on documentation. It follows the familiar patterns of Backus-Naur Form, and includes a number of innovations that make it also suitable for describing binary data.<p>Link here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;dogma&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;dogma_v1.md<p>I&#x27;ve been working hard after the feedback I got in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34720488 and would really appreciate another round of critiques :)<p>A lot of the changes were to harmonize the grammar so that the language &quot;feels&quot; more consistent with fewer surprising behaviors and edge cases.<p>Specific changes to address previous feedback:<p>* Changed the name to &quot;Dogma&quot; because it describes how things should be.<p>* Added an &quot;above-the-fold&quot; introductory example.<p>* Added the &quot;eod&quot; function to match the end of the input.<p>* Removed the &quot;when&quot; function and replaced it with switch syntax.<p>* Renamed the &quot;bind&quot; function to the &quot;var&quot; function.<p>* Removed &quot;any_type&quot; from the grammar.<p>* Introduced &quot;bits&quot; as a formal type. &quot;expression&quot; now refers to expressions of any type.<p>* The &quot;bits&quot; type can also be compared to produce a condition.<p>* Added the &quot;!=&quot;&quot; comparator.<p>* Split numbers into singular types and set types.<p>* Number sets can now be constructed using alternatives and exclusion.<p>* Removed &quot;real&quot; since it&#x27;s just a number with no invariant. Use &quot;number&quot; and &quot;numbers&quot; instead.<p>* &quot;signed&quot; and &quot;unsigned&quot; have been renamed to &quot;sinteger&quot; and &quot;uinteger&quot; to emphasize the integer invariant.<p>* ieee754 special floating point values NaN, inf, and negative 0 are now generated via special functions, and have no &quot;number&quot; representation.<p>* Modulo division now uses truncation, following with most popular languages.<p>* Undefined arithmetic operations are no longer allowed.<p>* The variadic parameter specifier can only be applied to the last argument of a function (bugfix).<p>* Clarified what the parameter value 0 does in some functions.<p>* Removed alternatives operation for type names.<p>* Added note about Unicode equivalence and normalization.<p>* Removed character encoding length restriction.<p>* Switched out some contrived examples for real-world examples (UDP, Ethernet, RTP, TR-DOS file descriptor).<p>If you use metalanguage grammars, please take a gander and let me know where Dogma might cause problems in your use cases! Do note, however, that I&#x27;m trying to keep things fairly general to avoid diminishing returns.<p>Thanks :)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
