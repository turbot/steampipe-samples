If nothing else, to prepare me better for conversations with lawyers.<p>The short version is that I co-founded a company in US. I lived there for a while, but have been spending 95% of my time outside of the US. Due to unique tax situation in Mexico, I am not obliged to pay local taxes. Therefore, I have chosen to continue paying taxes in the US.<p>I want to stop renting an apartment in the US, which serves nothing more as the mailing address at the moment, and want to consider cheaper alternatives, e.g. virtual office or mail forwarding. If anyone has done this, do you know what are implications in terms of IRS, keeping my bank accounts, etc active in the US with this setup?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I finally ended up with Obsidian on the desktop, but it&#x27;s still difficult to access my knowledge anywhere online, until I made my own online wiki.<p>Things that helped me get to this step:<p>1. &quot;How to Take Smart Notes&quot;<p>2. Evergreen notes by Andy: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.andymatuschak.org&#x2F;Evergreen_notes"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.andymatuschak.org&#x2F;Evergreen_notes</a>.<p>This website shows the culmination of my personal knowledge with search bar. The idea is that I should be able to find what I&#x27;m looking for within seconds, otherwise the title of my notes are not specific enough or the web of knowledge is not good enough.<p>Most of the notes still have short title style and walls of texts, but the newer notes that I added are in evergreen note style. I&#x27;m slowly converting them to permanent notes.<p>Good example pages of permanent notes:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.krxiang.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;pleural_effusion"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.krxiang.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;pleural_effusion</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.krxiang.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;copd"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.krxiang.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;copd</a><p>The website is made with Astro for better static site generation. Notes are taking in markdown format in Obsidian, and I used a script to copy them over that runs on schedule. I  I tried Sveltekit first, but with several thousand markdown notes, I was not able to render the website on Netlify. CSS is done with tailwind. Search is added with Minisearch.<p>This was a very fun project. Everything from the search function to the subtle fade animation was satisfying to add.",story,https://wiki.krxiang.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
