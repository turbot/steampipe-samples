35281306,Ask HN: Will personal websites gain traction as AI content floods the web?,2023-03-23T21:08:56Z,rsolva,1,false,false,,,,,,"Many of us has already experienced reading an article we believed to be of human origin, but in fact was written by an AI. As many posts on Twitter and the Fediverse has shown us, AIs can be hilariously inaccurate – it will happily tell us what it thinks we want to hear and invent stuff as it goes.<p>In this environment, where it gets harder to discern the veracity of information online, be it from newspapers, magazines and other types of information outlets, establishing trust becomes increasingly valuable.<p>Will this fact make us seek out more personal content from sources we can put a face and a name to? A personal web of trust that sharpens the line between content made by humans and AIs?<p>It might be to early to call it, but having pondered on these questions for a little while, it made me realize that my solution to this sea-change is to double down on collecting channels of information that verifies ownership, like personal websites, preferably on a domain name owned by that very person.<p>Maybe we could even make some kind of pact, a code of honor, a personal promise of integrity, that guarantees a site to contain 100% human generated content?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I had tried copilot but that too felt like not an extreme advantage for typed languages over something like IntelliJ.<p>However, I have been trying GPT4 and seeing the rate of progress, and it all seems too much progression too fast. GPT4 is crazy good on all kinds of things (e.g. I asked it to make changes to python C internals to support some new language features and it came up with sensible changes). Unlike GPT3.5, I have so far not seen GPT4 just make up code functions. It hallucinates but the frequency seems much lesser. And with the pace that OpenAI is developing new things, it seems like it is even hard to predict what these models will be doing in 2 years.<p>Do you think we are witnessing the start of something with similar impact as the industrial revolution, but happening even faster and will dramatically change human civilisation?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
