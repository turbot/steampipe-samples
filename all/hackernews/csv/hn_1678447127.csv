35092903,Show HN: JazzKeys.fyi – Tutorials for jazz and funk keyboard players,2023-03-10T10:58:00Z,donbrae,1,false,false,,,,,,"Web developer and jazz piano player here. I’ve just launched JazzKeys.fyi (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;JazzKeys.fyi"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;JazzKeys.fyi</a>), a website of tutorials covering bebop, modern jazz, blues and funk. It’s more or less a brain dump of some of what I’ve learned over the course of playing and studying jazz for ~25 years. I would likely have found it useful back when I started, and I created it in the hope that it might be helpful to others.<p>The main audience for the site is people who already have some facility in playing a keyboard instrument (in any genre), and who want to learn jazz or improve their jazz playing. It assumes a basic understanding of how scales and chords work.<p>Building the animated keyboard that accompanies each musical example was quite a rewarding technical challenge. For anyone interested in the technical details, there is a blog post about it at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jamieonkeys.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;piano-keyboard-javascript&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jamieonkeys.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;piano-keyboard-javascript&#x2F;</a>.<p>I hope folk find the site to be a helpful resource.

35093017,Ask HN: Examples of Documentation for Games?,2023-03-10T11:18:26Z,raphael_l,1,false,false,,,,,,"This is a pet peeve topic of mine that I&#x27;ve never put forth for discussion, so here goes.<p>TL;DR: do you know of any examples of a good documentation of a specific game and its mechanics? And do you think these are necessary&#x2F;valuable?<p>I&#x27;ve just come into a discussion with a user on Reddit, because I was asking for a relative basic simple fact about a game (namely, Valorant – I will use this as a baseline example for here on out). The question was &quot;How much damage does a player need to afflict onto an enemy to get an assist?&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t say if it is a &quot;core&quot; mechanic of the game, but it&#x27;s very visible information right in the scoreboard and features into the &quot;ranking&quot; of the player after the game (which some might consider a valuable reward system). Now I don&#x27;t really care for assists themselves, hence why I have never paid close attention to it. I know it&#x27;s somewhat in the area of 40-50. Counter-Strike has 40, I&#x27;m pretty sure, which is why I was hesitant about 50 being the right number. So unless I wanted to play for a few hours and check out my damage numbers and rule out every possible combination, I searched for the number online. And I couldn&#x27;t find anything on it. The official website has only the most basic information about agents, maps and guns. But no underlying mechanics. There is a fandom wiki, which, AFAIK also doesn&#x27;t expose this information. I&#x27;m 100% sure the number is mentioned within a video, but I can&#x27;t randomly try to find the right info out of hours of material, right?<p>So I was stumped and went to the subreddit to ask for the answer (it seems to be 50, btw) and vent about how we don&#x27;t have any official documentation of the game mechanics of the games we play. More specifically I would say the mechanics of a highly competitive FPS, where variables are tweaked in the realm of milliseconds to make sure it is balanced.<p>And the user kind of went on a tangent on how I couldn&#x27;t tell this just purely by playing and why I would need every bit of information spoonfed as it is down &quot;nowadays&quot;.<p>Do you agree with that assessment? So professionally I come from a Design Systems background, which relies heavily on documentation and making sure everyone has access to the same information&#x2F;status quo. Am I somehow wrong to want companies (that specifically work on heavily competitive games) to be transparent about how the mechanics of the game work? That don&#x27;t rely on very specific circumstances to happen in-game so I can store this information somewhere?<p>My go to example for how &quot;lazy&quot; these companies are was this description of a skill ingame. The first one is the official description from the website. The second one is from the Fandom wiki. We rely on third-party providers to gather this information, rather than it being presented directly from the source.<p>&gt; Valorant website:<p>NULL&#x2F;CMD Instantly overload with polarized radianite energy that empowers KAY&#x2F;O and causes large energy pulses to emit from his location.

35092879,Ask HN: Is Pascal any good for modern programming?,2023-03-10T10:54:03Z,distcs,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN community! I know to program in languages like C, C++, Python, etc. I want to create small but robust programs and I think C gets in the way of that unless I write every line of code like a paranoid.<p>I know Rust offers a lot of safety features but I don&#x27;t like the ergonomics of it. Python has good ergonomics but is slow as hell. So here is what I am looking for in a programming language I can use for my small and robust programs:<p>- The language should have implementations that are popular and available for almost all popular architectures and operating systems.<p>- The language should have implementations that compile to machine code.<p>- The language should have been around for &gt;= 10 years.<p>- The language should have good ergonomics. It should not make me reinvent the wheel for simple things like file IO, substring search, etc.<p>- The language should not perform outright dangerous things silently. If I try to read beyond the end of an array the program should crash immediately.<p>- The language or its implementations should not have garbage collector.<p>After searching through many available languages I think Pascal might be it but I don&#x27;t know enough Pascal to make a call. So I am drawing upon the wisdom of HN community to find out if Pascal is a good fit here or if you have other suggestions for me.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
