33849478,Curation in the Age of Streaming and DVDs,2022-12-04T01:16:33Z,xtiansimon,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"In the &#x27;old days&#x27; of broadcast &amp; cable TV you&#x27;d turn on the television and watch _what is on_. This list of media was curated by the networks--what they can get and what&#x27;s available. You&#x27;d sit down and go through the listing and once in a while be surprised and find joy when an old favorite was scheduled.<p>For example, during the holiday season I watch old Christmas movies to get into the holiday spirit. I will certainly find the usual suspects: _It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life_ (1946), _Bishop&#x27;s Wife_ (1947), _White Christmas_ (1954). Then, once in a blue moon I&#x27;ll see _Christmas Eve_[[1]] (1947) with George Raft and Randolph Scott [[2]]--a quirky movie with an eccentric mother who runs a train set on her dining table to serve tea to guests [[3]] (It&#x27;s the best trope in the film, and every reason to rewatch it).<p>Today there is so much new content.<p>I&#x27;m trying to clear up my thoughts on this idea of *what compells us to rewatch an old favorite*. I&#x27;m fixated on the fact that in the &#x27;ol days you didn&#x27;t have much choice. This made watching classics fun, like a rediscovery. You watched what was on (and there&#x27;s a bit of convincing yourself you were happy to watch something you hadn&#x27;t seen in a while), and it was a mini-event. To find Christmas Eve scheduled, you would realize this showing might be the only chance to see it until next year.<p>Now with streaming and DVDs, you can watch whatever you want when you want to watch it. But this has taken away the fun of re-watching old classics. Now, it feels like it&#x27;s just a playlist. Where&#x27;s the joy?<p>In the social media age you can find curated lists of what&#x27;s _good_, or what&#x27;s _popular_, and then stick into your list a surprise classic.<p>What other forms of curation have you run into or can you imagine that compel us to rewatch classics?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0039266&#x2F;
