35427470,Tell HN: Instagram suspended my friend's business without warning or recourse,2023-04-03T17:07:45Z,mabunday,1,false,false,,,,,,"My friend Clio has spent the past few years building her own fashion brand in NYC. She painstakingly designs all of her clothes by hand, putting months of effort into single pieces.<p>Clio recently released her fall-winter 2023 collection. She has a website for her brand (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cliogalea.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;fw23-angel-fire-disco-club), but in NYC in the fashion industry most business is still conducted on Instagram. Her new collection was received with great interest and Clio was in the middle of corresponding with some important business connections when--without warning, notice, or reason given--Instagram suspended her brand&#x27;s account (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;cliogalea&#x2F;). This has had the following impacts:<p>1. For the agents and representatives she was corresponding with, she now has no way to contact them - potentially compromising impactful business opportunities.
2. For her current clientele who are awaiting orders or commissions and have already committed deposits, having her brand page disappear without warning has caused confusion and concern.
3. All references to her brand and her new collection have disappeared from Instagram due to the account being suspended pending investigation. Word of mouth on social media is a huge part of the fashion industry, particularly in NYC, and the timing is particularly devastating given the months of work that went into the release of her new collection.<p>When Clio&#x27;s account was suspended she was given no warning or reason for the suspension. She was told that she would receive an update on the suspension within 24 hours, but there&#x27;s been no correspondence for days nor opportunity for her to gain clarity or appeal the suspension.<p>I know HN may say this is just another reason to avoid dependency on Instagram, Google, etc. in case access is revoked and I agree with this, but for small businesses like Clio&#x27;s, Instagram is a necessity until there is a systemic change to how the fashion industry operates.<p>For me personally, it&#x27;s especially concerning that we seem to be moving towards a world in which increasingly many decisions will be delegated to automated systems and there will be no opportunity for recourse. Throughout this process Clio has not been able to speak to a single human at Instagram about why her account was suspended. I can only imagine the situation becoming more stark in the future with large language models becoming more accessible.<p>If anyone has any advice here on how to navigate this situation or get my friend&#x27;s account restored, it would be greatly appreciated.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I’m Joseph, and along with Arpan and Bailey we are the founders of OutSail Shipping (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outsailshipping.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outsailshipping.com&#x2F;</a>). We’re building a sail the size of a 747 that rolls up into a shipping container. When deployed, it will generate thrust from the wind to reduce the fuel consumption of a cargo ship. An array of these devices will reduce fuel consumption on ships by up to 20%. These sails are easily stowed and removed to cause no interference with cargo operations. Here’s a short video showing our prototype: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VUpVqzpym54"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VUpVqzpym54</a>.<p>Sails powered ships for millennia; but then the convenience of energy-dense fuels displaced sails. As ship speeds eventually exceeded wind speeds, the consensus became that sails had no place in shipping and were relegated to hobbyists and sport. Fast forward a century and a half, and maritime shipping, like all other industries, is facing a reckoning to mitigate the greenhouse gasses produced by their activities.<p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has introduced new regulations which use a vessel’s Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) to grade ships. This grading scale becomes more aggressive over time, and any ship with a poor grade must take corrective action. The corrective actions can be as non-invasive as reducing speed (aka: slow steaming) or as extreme as a retrofit to use a different, cleaner fuel source. This costs millions and takes a ship out of commission for months, and it’s difficult to ensure your (now more expensive) fuel is available at every port of call. Ship owners are hedging their bets that slow steaming will dominate their future, with ship order books full to reflect the increased capacity needed when containers take 20% longer to cross the ocean.<p>Or option three. There is sufficient wind on the ocean to power the entire shipping industry, if you’re willing to grab it. Wind Assisted Ship Propulsion (WASP) devices can be used as a corrective action to improve a vessel’s CII rating, without reducing ship speed or changing the route. In other words, a return of sails.<p>We are   hardware engineers with over two decades of experience between us, working at Tesla, SpaceX, JPL, Relativity, and some startups. The idea for OutSail came from Arpan and Joseph getting coffee after work one day. When we asked each other “What would you do if you weren’t building satellites?” maritime cargo came up from both sides; Arpan from having studied the industry for opportunities to reduce emissions, and Joseph from a love of hydrodynamics and maybe too many sea-shanties. Bailey and Arpan, meanwhile, had been looking at working on bicycling infrastructure. What brought the three of us together was actually a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game where we realized we made a good team! We settled on OutSail as a good fit for our hardware hacking mentality, trading in our druids staffs for spanners.<p>Aerodynamically, sails are simply vertical wings. Wind blowing across the vessel causes the sail to generate lift and drag, and the resultant vector has some forward component to pull the ship through the water. However, if the wind comes from an angle too close to the direction of travel, there is no thrust. As an added complication, the sail only sees the <i>relative</i> wind. If the ship travels faster, the wind will appear to come from closer and closer to the direction of travel, even if the true wind is coming from perpendicular to your course! Despite this, standard sails can still produce forward thrust as long as the wind is at least 20 degrees off from directly in front of the vessel. This is how our sails can still save power, even on a fast moving vessel.<p>There are many sail technologies out there. A common question we get asked is “Are you going to use flettner rotors&#x2F;suction airfoils?”. Both of these technologies use power supplied by the ship to increase the lift produced by a surface; rotor-sails spin, and suction airfoils…suck? Each of these have a place, especially at low vessel speeds. But our customers ask us for a solution that works for container ships cruising at the relatively high speed of 22kt. At these speeds, the relative wind is almost always ahead of you, so lift&#x2F;drag becomes more important. Powered sails suffer from poor lift&#x2F;drag, both from the high induced drag from very high lift coefficients, and system losses from drawing on ship’s power. So no we are not going with flettner rotors&#x2F;suction airfoils. While they are the new exciting technology on the block, if you factor in their power usage and high drag ratio, they are just not as practical as a simple sail.<p>So now that we’ve given a general summary of sailing, it’s time to explain how a 747 wing will ever fit inside a 9ft tall cargo container. It’s simple really: imagine a tape measure. In a tape measure a thin, flexible strip of metal is wound into a spiral. Then, when the metal is uncoiled, it naturally returns to its original shape.  That’s exactly how we plan to make our sails. The skin of our sail or the inner spars (we haven’t finalized our design) will be made of tape measure like material (2mm thick steel) and the wing will be able to extend out of the cargo container. The video in the first paragraph explains this in a bit more detail.<p>By fitting our sail into a cargo container we allow for our device to be installed on any cargo ship right at port.  Remember how we mentioned that some shippers are ordering a lot more ships and some ships are getting retrofitted with new fuel? Well, shipyards are backed up for the next 5 years. By making a device that requires no shipyard to install, not only will we drastically outcompete other retrofit WASP companies in terms of deployment cost, but we will be the only company with a product shippers can put on their ship without a multiple year wait time.<p>Do you have any interesting stories around sailing or wind tech? We would love to hear your ideas, experiences, and feedback on any and all of the above!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
