If every person in the world today had a nuclear weapon the world would already have been destroyed many times over. The only hope for humanity is that somehow we create a benevolent AI dictator that’s more powerful than the other AIs and is able to prevent them from causing damage. I guess that’s a possible scenario but it’s pretty bleak that the bull case for AI is having an AI master controlling the world as a totalitarian dictator. My take is that it would be best for humanity to avoid any advanced AI development, although I understand that’s probably impossible.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I co-founded my own four years ago but we ran out of cash about a year ago. Burnt out, I took a job offer from a previous client, which is a medium-sized manufacturing company of about 500 people, to create an &quot;digital transformation&quot; department (parallel to an &quot;IT&quot; team). We have mostly developing software to automate things and providing technical advice here and there.<p>I suppose because the company thought I did a good job and the original &quot;IT&quot; team didn&#x27;t, they&#x27;re merging my team and the &quot;IT&quot; team and put me in charge – of all the team and the responsibilities.<p>Suddenly, in addition to software development, I&#x27;ll need to worry about the &quot;IT&quot; decisions: which computers to buy for the colleagues; lease or buy the printers; physical server or cloud; introducing a &quot;MES&quot; to improve factory efficiency; compliances regarding personal information etc.<p>## The question<p>My questions is, how does a developer become good at the &quot;IT&quot; things? I understand the need to communicate and understand the business model, etc. But I don&#x27;t know how to make good decisions and more importantly, how to gather information that support my decision. I have an intuition about how to simplify a function, but no idea about formulating a BYOD policy.<p>So, how do I become a good IT manager? Which books should I read? Which blogs should I subscribe to? What can I do to ensure that I&#x27;ll do a good job?
