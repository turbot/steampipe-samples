You always worry something is going to break. Unit tests are not enough. 
You need to have a way to test if (for example) the HTTP request to register a user will trigger that welcome e-mail at the end of the flow.<p>So we&#x27;ve build an open source framework where you can simply write such tests. 
You can assert on database queries, on HTTP requests and responses, and more to come. 
We use traces from OpenTelemetry to verify that the assertions you wrote in your test are true.<p>Our long term goal is to even generate the tests automatically from those traces.<p>We&#x27;re still early on so would love to get any feedback on our concept and implementation!<p>repo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;traceloop&#x2F;jest-opentelemetry"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;traceloop&#x2F;jest-opentelemetry</a><p>docs: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.traceloop.dev&#x2F;jest-otel&#x2F;introduction"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.traceloop.dev&#x2F;jest-otel&#x2F;introduction</a>",story,https://github.com/traceloop/jest-opentelemetry,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This triggered a debate among the team: which bugs do we fix now?  Which do we fix later?  And when is later?  If we don&#x27;t fix them now, will we realistically ever fix them?<p>This led us to an interesting question: what if we just split <i>all</i> bugs into &quot;will fix&quot; and &quot;won&#x27;t fix&quot;, and then prioritise every &quot;will fix&quot; above all new features....always.  In other words: we commit to only ever adding new features when we&#x27;re bug free.<p>Has anybody tried this?  Can it work?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
