  - User-provided data: &quot;about me&quot;, dietary requirements, out-of-office &#x2F; availability indicator, ...

There would also be rollup pages with metadata for each team, office location, etc.<p>Ideally there would also be the possibility to add custom plugins (e.g. gamifying activities like interviewing by displaying achievements on a profile page).<p>This kind of corporate directory functionality is often seen as a bolt-on to an HR information system. They typically bring along a simple tabular viewing app that invariably have a terrible UX, and never support data integrations with other systems. There doesn&#x27;t appear to be meaningful interest from established players to invest in this domain, despite it being a great source of grassroots vendor lock-in if they can build something beautiful.<p>One option we have is to devote some of our internal development efforts to build such an app. In a ~200 person company, the opportunity cost of development and ongoing maintenance probably isn&#x27;t worthwhile.<p>Do you have recommendations for a corporate directory app a company could deploy, either OSS or commercial?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I am not saying a CS program shouldn&#x27;t have subjects like Discrete Math, TCS, Compilers, Type Theory, etc. But along with all that why not teach them the skill of &quot;good programming&quot;. By that I don&#x27;t mean only syntax of popular languages. I mean the art of solving problems using programming languages.<p>All I am saying is that majority of the undergrad population will be employed as a coder somewhere directly or indirectly. Very few people will go to grad school. Then why do we just touch upon programming in most schools? There are schools where a typical undergrad Algorithms class has no coding assignments. Ofcourse there are schools where there are courses with extensive programming requirements. I am not talking about those. Those are exceptions.<p>Just as an analogy, can a person majoring in architecture not do drawing or designing? Even they have courses that teach principles. Then why are CS programs so practicality averse? Why not accept that programming is a good and powerful tool and like any other tool, the mastery of it can be taught (through guided practice and not only lone practice). Lone dedicated practice is important. But someone who has enrolled in college can expect guided practice from their program. Don&#x27;t say, that it is the job of companies where they intern to teach them to get better at programming? What legal or moral obligation do they have to perform that as a duty?<p>Is it because most academicians are bad programmers (it may be a fact, nothing wrong in that, don&#x27;t get offended, I&#x27;m just asking)? Or are there other reasons.<p>There will be people who will point out the exceptions to my topic. I am very open to hear about those experiences too.
