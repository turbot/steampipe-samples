For some context, I have never been in a humanitarian crisis such as the Turkey&#x2F;Syria earthquakes or the Ukraine war, but I see the immense suffering and challenges these events bring. 
I hypothesis that a system as described above could have a positive, possibly even massive, impact on victims of these events. 
It seems so obvious that I can’t imagine they don’t exist, yet, I can’t find a system like this out there. 
Thanks for your help. 
My thoughts are with the victims of the aforementioned earthquakes right now.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

There&#x27;s a lot more social capital with being a software engineer now.
