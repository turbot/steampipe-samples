I wonder what are the things HNsers are curious about or trying out that are getting lost in the noise?<p>for example I have been getting it to recreate classic art with HTML canvas, output it responses in homoglyphs, write useful bash system maintenance scripts in the style of Talk therapy for computers, draft outlines for things I need to write, and so on and so forth..",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
