Since then I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking on my next &quot;idea&quot;. Rationally I know there is nothing that kills creativity like trying to be creative, one of my reference on the topic is Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;25670869. That being said, this entrepreneurial goal has polluted everything in my life and the way I see the world. I stopped to genuinely enjoy experience since everything became a potential problem to solve, I started to be less present during interaction with other people and I pretended to have less time for things that I like because of some phantomatic idea I had to test. I recently started meditating with Sam Harris&#x27;s Waking up, which is really helping on bringing more awareness in my life, not solving my problems but at least acknowledge those are there. My goal is to understand if I still really want to be an entrepreneur or  I&#x27;m just projecting expectations from the shadow of the past success, if the answer is yes I want to keep my exploration in a more sane journey. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only one experiencing what I described, did anybody deal with it &#x2F; are you dealing with this? What was your experience did you find something that worked for you?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
