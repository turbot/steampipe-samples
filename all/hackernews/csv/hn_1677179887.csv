When our new Figma payment platform launches, all files will need to include usable content in order to remain on Community. This means third-party payment links will no longer be allowed in Community files, and the contents of files may not primarily be used to advertise other resources.<p>We’ve moved our launch date to March 7 so you have more time to update your impacted file(s). With that in mind, here’s what you need to know:<p>You will need to remove third-party payment links and advertisements from your files and submit them for review to the Figma team by this Friday (February 24). Doing so will ensure that your files stay up on Community when we launch.
After this deadline, your files won’t be available on Community until you make the necessary changes.
If you are interested in selling a new file, plugin, or widget with our payment platform, please apply here.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
