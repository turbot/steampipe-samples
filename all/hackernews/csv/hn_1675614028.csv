Writing a program to do this is possible, but so far it has turned out to be more complex than expected due to the lack of good libraries available to accomplish this task.<p>Some of our accounts have hundreds of gigabyte so therefore something with a delta migration would be amazing.<p>Any suggestions or experiences with certain tools would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!<p>PS: Im quite stunned that the integrated migration assistant in office 365 is soo bad, even when connecting to recent exchange servers",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
