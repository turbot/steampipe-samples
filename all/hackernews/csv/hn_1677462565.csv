34951951,Ask HN: How can I enable a dumber phone to carry sometimes?,2023-02-27T01:41:36Z,deanebarker,1,false,false,,,,,,"I use my smartphone too much. I&#x27;m trying to embrace boredom, so I&#x27;ve been leaving it behind when I go out to dinner and such.<p>However, I&#x27;d still like to be contactable via text during those times. (Apps are the problem -- social media, news, etc.)<p>I still need my smartphone often, like when I travel or when I&#x27;m in a work meeting. So I cannot switch to a dumb phone permanently.<p>But when I&#x27;m out for social occasions, I&#x27;d like to just take a device that only texts. (I don&#x27;t even need voice.)<p>I can get a dumb phone, but can get my phone number to send texts to two devices? Then I could take the dumb phone when I want to detach a bit.<p>Or are there smartwatches that just receive texts and no other notifications?<p>I looked at The Light Phone, but it looks like that requires you to actually switch phones.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelightphone.com&#x2F;products<p>This would be perfect if I could have in addition to my smart phone and just choose which one to take when I leave the house.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
