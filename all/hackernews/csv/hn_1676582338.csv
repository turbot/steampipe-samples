Coming from Emacs and Vim, I wanted my Google Sheets usage to be more keyboard driven, so I made this extension.

34826036,Show HN: Reflow – a kanban-style project management software within VSCode,2023-02-16T20:59:19Z,simozampa,3,false,false,,,,,,"Hi Hacker News<p>I am happy to share my projet: Reflow.
Reflow is a VSCode extension that allows you to plan, track, and manage your projects directly within the VSCode editor.<p>With Reflow, you can:
- Break down your codebase into customized tasks
- Create multiple workspaces, boards and statuses to track projects and sprints
- Assign priority, tags, and users directly to the task
- Collaborate in real-time with team members within VSCode
- Link tasks to code snippets and files<p>Checkout our VSCode Marketplace page to know more about Reflow!<p>Reflow is still in beta and it was developed by a team of two.
It is free to use. However, we plan to have a premium subscription for teams of more than 3 people in the future. 
We also plan to develop integrations to other PM tools, such as Jira and Clickup.<p>Why we built it:
We are tired of using external tools to keep track of our code. Switching between the editor and the browser is a distraction. But more importantly, tasks in other tools lack the most important context: the code. With Reflow we can finally link each task to different snippets of code and files, which brings clarity and meaning to the codebase.<p>I am looking forward to your feedback and let me know if you have any questions :)",story,https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Reflow.reflow,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
