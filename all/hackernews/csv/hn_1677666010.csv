We have a poverty rate of over 80%, illiteracy rate of over 60%, high insecurity and violence. Yet, we just voted in a documented drug trafficker and extremely corrupt person as our incoming President [1].<p>Most of the votes for this candidate came from the Northern part of the country, the part with the highest poverty, illiteracy, and insecurity. Yet, the people from this region overlook their economic interests and are more interested in tribal and religious politics.<p>Once upon a time, we were improving and seeing progress...until 2015 when we elected a former military dictator who is very clueless about the state of affairs [2]. Since then, we have backslidden on all levels...poverty has become higher, my hometown has become ravaged by separatist violence [3], the economy is very bleak and continues to worsen.<p>I have lost hope. I never wanted to immigrate because I find it odd to stay in someone else&#x27;s country, but I&#x27;m considering it now. Even at that, my passport registration got botched because of an incompetent immigration official that can&#x27;t tell the difference between &quot;new&quot; and &quot;renew&quot;, and I&#x27;ll have to wait many more months for it to go through. I don&#x27;t even mind if I end up in a monarchy like Oman and Qatar...as much as I detest that system, they seem to be performing a better job than our democratic leaders here.<p>I&#x27;m just tired...please, cherish your country if you live in a good one. Do the best to continue to vote in competent and good leaders. I don&#x27;t want you to ever end up in my position.<p>1- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prnigeria.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;fact-check-tinubu&#x2F;<p>2- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.premiumtimesng.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;180422-inec-declares-buhari-president-elect.html?tztc=1<p>3- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thisdaylive.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;26&#x2F;in-anambra-even-policemen-live-in-fear&#x2F;",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
