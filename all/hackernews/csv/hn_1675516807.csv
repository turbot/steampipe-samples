Books can be read in single, or dual language mode. Any language combination is possible.<p>Research shows:
- clear benefits of children that are being read to from an early age. 
- parents should read to their children in the language they are most proficient in, which might be a different language from the one used in 
school, and therefore a language that makes it harder for them to acquire books for.<p>With BookaBooka I hope to provide all children in the world, including immigrants, expats and refugees with a library in their native tongue, and the privilege of being read to, even if parents aren&#x27;t able.<p>I work with a growing network of language enthusiasts that help me translate &#x2F; narrate our collection. These people work on a semi-voluntary basis (royalty model + low revenue currently resembles volunteer work).<p>You can try BookaBooka out for free, it is available in all major appstores (ios, google, microsoft).",story,https://www.bookabooka.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34654162,Ask HN: Is there a way to find the max brightness (nits) of a monitor?,2023-02-04T13:09:21Z,alin23,1,false,false,,,,,,"I develop Lunar (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunar.fyi&#x2F;), a macOS app for controlling the hardware brightness of monitors.<p>One of its hallmark features is Sync Mode: an adaptive brightness algorithm that can keep the brightness synced between multiple monitors.<p>Because people usually have different monitor models in the same setup, their luminance curves vary a lot, so 100% on one can have the same perceived brightness as 80% on another. Users can account for this variance by adjusting the curve slope manually in Lunar’s settings, or by fine tuning each monitor until all look the same and have Lunar learn from these adjustments.<p>I’d like to make this automatic, so that people get already synced curves for each monitor. For that I would need the max brightness value measured in nits or cd&#x2F;m2 for each monitor but my research hasn’t turned up much.<p>Is there a database containing this type of information that I don’t know of? Or maybe a way to read&#x2F;extrapolate this data from monitor memory?<p>Things I have tried:<p><pre><code>    - looking in the EDID
    - sifting through macOS I&#x2F;O Registry data using “ioreg -l -c AppleCLCD2” (on arm64)

34653970,Show HN: Mass Dissent – Easily send a letter to U.S. Congress representatives,2023-02-04T12:30:21Z,spencewenski,3,false,false,2,"[34654019,34654179]",,,,"Hi HN!<p>I just launched the MVP of Mass Dissent, a website that provides an easy way to send a short message as physical mail to your representatives in the U.S. Congress. The site reduces the effort required to send a letter to an elected official, hopefully resulting in more people writing to their representatives regarding the issues they care about.<p>Originally, the idea was to allow users to select Tweets to print onto a postcard that would be sent to their representatives. However, last fall the Twitter OAuth API stopped working (for me at least), so I decided to pivot slightly to allowing users to compose a message directly on Mass Dissent. This has a side benefit of allowing users to write longer messages than what would be available using Tweets.<p>Some notes on the technologies used:<p>- The code is written in TypeScript[1], uses Next.js[2] and the MUI[3] React component library for the UI, and the backend APIs are created using tRPC[4].<p>- The site is hosted on Vercel[5] and it&#x27;s using Supabase[6] for the DB.<p>- The messages themselves are printed and mailed using Lob[7]. I also store the representatives&#x27; addresses in Lob so I don&#x27;t need to maintain a separate DB table for this.<p>- I&#x27;m able to get congress member data from the Congress.gov API[8] (though some post-processing is required because, for example, a few members are missing a headshot image). I created a little CLI tool using Rust[9] to fetch the data from Congress.gov, normalize it for usage by the site, and upload the addresses to Lob. The representatives data is pretty static so I just store it as a big JSON file on the server-side.<p>- Payments are processed using Stripe[10] and payment notification emails are sent using Sendgrid[11].<p>- Previously, when the site was integrated with the Twitter OAuth API, it was also using NextAuth.js[12], but there currently isn&#x27;t much need for auth so I removed it for now.<p>At my day job I&#x27;m mainly a backend dev working with Java&#x2F;AWS, so it&#x27;s been a lot of fun playing with all these different technologies!<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;</a>
