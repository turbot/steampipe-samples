34662107,Show HN: GPTBanker – map/reduce over documents of any length with OpenAI,2023-02-05T05:07:02Z,aicharades,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi all! I created a app that can map&#x2F;reduce over documents of an arbitrary length with OpenAI completions.<p>You can enter in your OpenAI key and try it out.<p>The backend is built with LangChain, which made it easy to manage the models, workflows (chains), and troubleshoot pipelines with buffer issues.<p>Learnings:
- Tokens was the most helpful key for calls rather than characters or words. LangChain also just implemented a token splitter, which made it easier for me to adapt to documents of any type.
- Davinci performed much better than Curie for summarizing long documents over multiple chunks
- Oftentimes a map step was the only thing needed and the reduce&#x2F;combine introduced more errors instead of improving context.",story,https://www.wrotescan.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
