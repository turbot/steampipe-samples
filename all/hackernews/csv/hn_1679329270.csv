35233561,"Ask HN: Trying to be strategic about my career as a junior, any advice?",2023-03-20T16:01:39Z,juvvel,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi, long time lurker and first time poster here,<p>just a little bit of backstory: I&#x27;m coming back to the job market after a longer hiatus (for health reasons). I&#x27;m late-20s and currently feeling anxious about the future viability of tech as a career, especially with AI on the rise. Most senior devs seem to be fairly unfazed and confident in their skills. However, with only around 4 years of experience in web development (which is considered to be the &quot;easiest&quot; CS field), I&#x27;m worried about the next best career move.<p>With the advent of AI tools, I believe many companies will be very eager to replace junior developers such as myself -- regardless of whether it&#x27;s a smart move or not. This will likely lead to depressed salaries and more competition. I don&#x27;t love coding to the point where I&#x27;d do it just for the sake of it, so I don&#x27;t feel I could just &quot;stick it out&quot;. I had tried to be a graphic designer and was met with abysmal job prospects so I chose tech for its relatively better stability and pay. Now that that&#x27;s heavily under attack, and design&#x2F;art careers are also going to be threatened, what to do? I just haven&#x27;t had the time to hone my skillset for the last 10-15 years to make myself a highly sought-after senior. When the job is going to be 80% automated in the next 5 years, I wonder whether it&#x27;s still worth it trying to get better. All the skills I have or thought I was building seem to be becoming non-marketable in the near future.<p>How do you all cope with this feeling, if you have it? Have you taken steps to &quot;AI-proof&quot; your career? Or have you successfully transitioned away from tech?<p>Thanks in advance for any insights. I know I sound very defeated and anxious right now, because I am, but I&#x27;m here to try and gain a new, hopeful perspective.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
