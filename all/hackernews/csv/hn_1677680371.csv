Long story short, during Covid it became very popular and still is Number 1 in organic search on Google. We have more than one million users from every company in the world you can think of.<p>The tool is based on a freemium model with most of the features available as free, and we have a paid tier as well. The tool is used heavily with 180000-220000 users sessions and around 15000 new signups every month. We have spent zero amount on marketing and have not spent any efforts on sales etc.<p>All the growth is organic and word of mouth marketing. We believe there for the people with sales and marketing skills there is huge potential to either make it a real business with a very good MRR or  it can be a good strategic investment for any big player like MIRO, Monday or click up etc. Where they can acquire Million users from large enterprises and then use their sales teams to generate revenue out of it.<p>Now we are looking for some advice on how to approach those large players and negotiate with them etc. What is the standard process in Silicon Valley around this, we are based in Europe and would like to get some advice, input or potential contacts etc.<p>Thanks in advance!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
