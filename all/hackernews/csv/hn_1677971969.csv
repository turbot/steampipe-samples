I wanted to get the feedback from the HN community to see if it&#x27;s worth pursuing.<p>IMO, BeReal would make sense to add video, but they haven&#x27;t, which leads me to my idea. I&#x27;ve long thought that video should also be utilized for &quot;social&quot; and not only for &quot;media&quot; (TikTok, YT Shorts). I believe that there&#x27;s an opportunity to create an app revolving around video content that is entirely made up by friends.<p>The app would work like this: you would open the app and be greeted by the camera, you would then have to upload a video of what you&#x27;re doing to get access to the feed, and then every 24 hours it get reset. This wouldn&#x27;t involve a notification telling you to get on, but instead whenever you want to browse the app, you would need to upload a video of whatever you&#x27;re doing to get access. Now, it could be possible that people will post videos of a black screen to get access, BUT, you would think the same thing for BeReal, yet no one does that. Everyone uses BeReal for its intended purpose.<p>So what do you think? I&#x27;d love any feedback.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

But every now and then investment questions pop up, usually regarding the stock market, so I figured real estate deserved a little more love. It&#x27;s less spoken about because the barrier of entry seems higher and riskier, but as a software engineer with no network in the space who took a random plunge in REI years, it has worked out spectacularly for me.<p>I&#x27;m 28, so no gray hair RE investor wisdom to share exclusively, but I do know others way more experienced than I who would love to share their story and how they scaled their properties over time.<p>Would folks on HN be interested in reading in-depth profiles about experienced real estate investors?
