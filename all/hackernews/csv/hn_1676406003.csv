E.g. metrics are in Splunk, documents are probably in Confluence&#x2F;G-Docs etc.<p>But it&#x27;s hard to know how they all tie together unless you have it &quot;hardcoded&quot; in your head. E.g. you must know which dashboard in Splunk surfaces the metrics you&#x27;re looking for, you must also know which document&#x2F;runbook in Confluence has the relevant information on how to act on those metrics. And more often than not this documented information, if it exists at all, drifts from reality.<p>Worse yet, the need for this &quot;hardcoded&quot; information is precisely what makes onboarding new hires hard; it&#x27;s my least favorite part of joining a new team.<p>At one of my previous employers, we created a &quot;team page&quot; on the internal wiki that aggregated the team members&#x27; directory links, listed the services we owned, included some basic documentation and embedded metrics via iframes. But even that didn&#x27;t meet our needs fully.<p>Wondering what the HN community feels about this problem (is it even a problem?) and if someone&#x27;s using a tool that solves this for them at some level.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
