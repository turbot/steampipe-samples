For better or worse, the choir uses (not exclusively) Facebook to communicate internally, and Facebook and Instagram to promote shows.<p>A few weeks ago, her personal account, and the Facebook and Instagram accounts for the choir, were all suspended. Facebook provides a form[0] for appealing this - upon submission, the form throws up an error saying &quot;Your form couldn&#x27;t be sent. Log in to your Facebook account for more information about how to request a review.&quot; which is incredibly unhelpful.<p>From what we can tell, one account or other was compromised and some pornographic material was posted on the choir&#x27;s Instagram. A cursory examination of all the accounts&#x27; history&#x2F;logs would show this.<p>So this is a last-ditch effort to find any other avenue to pursue. It might sound trivial, but I can see this affecting her mental health - both from the impact it&#x27;s had on the choir and the personal feeling of unease that can come from this kind of compromise.
