I&#x27;d probably get paid more as well.<p>This comes with it&#x27;s own set of special problems of course, I&#x27;ll probably have to open a company in the country itself to receive money from the US based company, otherwise I&#x27;m sure the banks will give me problems for loans etc. in the future.<p>Anyway, my question is this:
Would you as a US based company hire a software dev from Latam? Are there any gotchas that make this process difficult?<p>If you&#x27;re a company and you have hired devs in that part of the world, what is the usual compensation levels you&#x27;re looking at? Going by my salary here in Europe, and the economy in the country I&#x27;m planning to move to, I&#x27;d be happy around $80k, but what is a good number to ask should I get in contact with companies?<p>Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
