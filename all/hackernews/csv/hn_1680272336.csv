With an emphasis on simplicity and ease of use, NiceGUI empowers Python developers to create user-friendly graphical web-based interfaces while focusing on their Python code. The library has been well-received, boasting 3000+ stars on GitHub and a growing community.<p>Lately we&#x27;ve introduced the &quot;native&quot; mode, which paves the way for Electron-like capabilities. By using &quot;ui.run(native=True)&quot;, you can now create a native desktop window using pywebview, offering desktop-feeling on Windows, Mac, and Linux.<p>Check out the video demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;xmWG2SP9WAI<p>Technical details:<p>NiceGUI uses FastAPI in the backend and Vue3&#x2F;Quasar in the frontend<p>Each user interaction is sent via WebSocket to the backend, processed in Python; similarly, UI descriptions are created as JSON objects in the backend and sent via WebSocket to the client<p>While there are still many features missing for a full Electron alternative, with the great community, we will flesh this out in the future<p>The whole backend-first approach from NiceGUI relies on a fast internet connection and therefore is not meant to replace classical web apps; its main purpose is a quick way to build user interfaces for your Python code<p>We know the Hacker News community values technical details, and we invite you to dive into the GitHub repository (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zauberzeug&#x2F;nicegui&#x2F;) to explore the code and contribute.

It also has a lightning-fast, Rust-based window compositing, scaling, and streaming engine now.<p>CoScreen was always meant to be different so that you and your team can share your screens simultaneously and multi-directionally, and to be able to control what is being shared. We saw it as a natural extension and closely coupled with your OS — instant, fast, and seamless. A better way to pair program, debug tough incidents, or jam on great ideas by sharing multi-modal information like code, commands, graphs, or logs.<p>All that made a lot of sense conceptually but to be frank, it was hard to get it right. Now a part of Datadog and with major parts of our app rewritten in Rust, we feel we’re closer than ever.<p>Here’s what pair programmers liked about CoScreen, so we made it even better:
- High definition code sharing: Windows are video-streamed in real-time at their native resolution whenever possible. You never have to search for your IDE anymore or be anxious to share the wrong window. 
- Multi-directional collaboration: You can share, while Alice shares, while Bob shares. Side-by-side, across multiple displays. With built-in crisp audio and video chat.
- 60FPS+ super smooth mouse pointers. Type, click, and draw on any shared window as if it was your own.<p>What some of you did NOT like, so we fixed it in CoScreen V5:
- CPU utilization and latency have been reduced drastically as various parts of our desktop client are now implemented in Rust, building on crates such as cxx, rust-skia, iced, as well as Neon for our native remote control plugins.
- No more accidental clicking into remote windows through the new remote window toggles.
- You’re no longer bound by your displays, can share windows from multiple of them at the same time and even move them across displays while sharing without stopping.
- You’ll also soon be able to join meetings from your browser from any platform.<p>CoScreen runs on macOS (x64 and Apple Silicon), Windows, soon also on the web and is currently free. We’re planning to charge for larger teams and enterprise features in the future. Hopefully - finally - we’ll also have a Linux version one day.
