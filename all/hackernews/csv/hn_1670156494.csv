33852882,All clients of IV.lt domain registrar are receving unsolicited invoices,2022-12-04T12:02:17Z,ek9,3,false,false,1,[33852994],<null>,<null>,<null>,"One of the biggest .lt domain registrars Interneto Vizija (iv.lt) recently have sent invoices to all of it&#x27;s clients for unsolicited VPN services.<p>I have domains registered with iv.lt so do a lot of my clients to which I&#x27;ve so far recommended their services. Their technical support is top notch and through the years the services they&#x27;ve provided were top notch. Few times there were issues - everything was solved in a timely manner and I&#x27;ve only had good experiences with registrar, to the point where I&#x27;ve recommended their services to my clients.<p>During November they&#x27;ve had &quot;Free VPN&quot; offer - allowing any of their existing clients to use VPN service for free.<p>What happened on December 2nd - everyone having an account with iv.lt has received an invoice from them for &quot;extending VPN service&quot; for the next 12 months. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;ve used the service during the free period nor if you really showed any interest in it - everyone received an invoice.<p>Now I have a situation where most of my clients are asking to explain the basis of this invoice they have received and I have to explain that this is baseless invoice that should be ignored.<p>When contacting iv.lt support to explain the basis of the invoice when I have never ordered nor used said VPN service (even during the &quot;free period&quot;) - I&#x27;ve got a reply saying that I need to go and cancel such services in my control panel.<p>This is really an unethical way of sending such invoices, given the fact that a lot of the times their existing clients have no sufficient technical knowledge to decide if such service is needed or not. For a lot of the clients that have their domain registered with iv.lt or possibly also have hosting services, they might just decide to pay the invoice thinking that it&#x27;s needed to keep their current websites running smoothly. This seems like a really questionable way of dealing with the end of &quot;free VPN&quot; offer.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
