A few months ago we decided to make it more ready for a wider audience. We’re not yet fully there but we’re at a point where we can start showing what it can do. It was built with Angular so we’re starting with Angular generators…in fact, we used Stackjoy to build Stackjoy.<p>It may not be something you’d use now for your software development but we have many more ready-to-use examples coming. Stackjoy is language agnostic so it works for any programming language.<p>If it is something you could see yourself using we’d really appreciate your feedback. Even if it’s not, we’d appreciate your feedback too so we can better understand why and hopefully we can address it in the future.<p>Lastly, if you have any suggestion for code generators you’d like to see, we are happy to hear about it and put it on our list.",story,https://blog.stackjoy.com/create-angular-components-with-stackjoy-9f94c91ee571,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
