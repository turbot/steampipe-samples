When we started migrating the integration tests, I noticed that we were spending a lot of time creating fake objects to populate the database before the tests. Previously, our factory methods were all untyped (they were created before our migration to TS), so it was hard to make them work with Prisma. Also, every time we add or remove a field, the factories would break. That&#x27;s when I decided to investigate if there was a better way.<p>`prisma-generator-fake-data` allows you to easily generate realistic fake data that you can use for testing, prototyping, or anything in between.
If you&#x27;re using JSON fields in Prisma, it allows you to provide your own fake data generator function.<p>Let me know what you think!",story,https://github.com/luisrudge/prisma-generator-fake-data,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
