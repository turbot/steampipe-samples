35366467,Let's give some heat to Elon and,2023-03-30T01:20:53Z,kishanZ3NS,1,false,false,,,,,,"This is my first post here! I hope it does well. I&#x27;m Kishan, a Computer Science student at SRMIST, India. I&#x27;ve built a number of apps, but they failed miserably. Still no worries bro, here&#x27;s my new app, Tinng (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinng.live&#x2F;). I think I can hit the bell with this one!<p>-Ok why another Twitter alternative?Seriously! I love Elon! I&#x27;m his die hard fan. I absolutely love SpaceX and Tesla! But what&#x27;s happening with Twitter is crazy. You should agree with me here. He&#x27;s giving some crazy updates everyday, one day he&#x27;s saying you&#x27;re going to see only verified account tweets on &quot;For You&quot; the next day he said you&#x27;ll also see tweets from the account you follow... Dude seriously?! There&#x27;s a separate tab for that, &quot;Following&quot;! Is he going to kill that tab? If he kills that then the concept of &quot;For You&quot; will be erased. There&#x27;s no strong competitor for twitter right now. So guy is bending everything and of course people are still going to use twitter when there&#x27;s no strong competition.<p>-Secondly, for participating in polls you need verification from Apr-15. Dude that&#x27;s like... I don&#x27;t know how to say it!  Can&#x27;t imagine what he comes up with next... Maybe replying will also be a part of the blue feature? God who knows!<p>-Now when a platform reaches millions of users, it&#x27;s the platform&#x27;s responsibility to make sure that the users identify the real user from the spams. That&#x27;s why the whole verification thing was invented right?! But calling something Blue subscription  in that is a bummer!<p>BUT TINNG IS NOT JUST ANOTHER TWITTER ALTERNATIVE! IT&#x27;S JUST TINNG! TINNG!!!<p>I don&#x27;t want Tinng to be like Mastodon, Bluesky, Spill or even whitesky. I don&#x27;t want to create an app that has a different name but same like twitter. That&#x27;s why I created it with a specific concept. Here it goes<p>Tinng is a social media app where you can share your thoughts like you share tweets on Twitter. But here you share it as &quot;Tinngs&quot; and these tinngs live only for 24 hours. Making sure all the content on the platform are fresh, much needed for news. And when your tinng gets more fires(Zaps) it lives longer. 5 seconds are added to the lifetime of your tinng for every zap so that your tinng can live longer. And when it gets many zaps, it gets featured in the &quot;Piping Hot&quot; page. That&#x27;s because when a tinng catches a wild fire it becomes piping hot. Piping Hot is used to feature the trending stuffs that are shared on the platform.<p>There are a few things I need to get done before releasing the app. Will get it done soon. And there&#x27;s a waitlist to try the beta. You can join the waitlist here (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinng.live&#x2F;). I&#x27;ll invite y&#x27;all from the waitlist to try Tinng.<p>Thanks in advance for joining the waitlist!<p>I really wanna create a new social app that can given real heats to twitter and elon. I want your support guys. Also please make your friends join the waitlist too. Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret the experience with Tinng.<p>Here are future features:
1. Identity verification for all users to ensure quality environment
2. More interactability with tinngs
3. A new kind of virtual meeting spot
4. Do you want a super app? First let&#x27;s see how this goes lol! 
5. Sleek UI, I want it the apple way with some futuristic things
6. I want to create an environment inside Tinng",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
