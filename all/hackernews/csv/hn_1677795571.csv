35002710,Unleashing the Power of COBOL and Clean Code: Foward Pass in Legacy Languages,2023-03-02T22:03:51Z,LangIsAllWeNeed,2,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;ve been working on a project that involves primarily developing a neural network in Cobol, and its been a real interesting experience. I&#x27;m hitting some roadblocks unfortunately but I have learned a lot about computation and life. My code is clean but my data is dirty.<p>I know Cobol is not the most cutting-edge language out there, but it has some serious advantages when it comes to reliability and security. 
I&#x27;ve been able to get the backpropagation algorithm working pretty well, but I&#x27;m running into issues with the forward pass. Specifically, I&#x27;m struggling with the activation functions and how to implement them in Cobol. I&#x27;m using a sigmoid function, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing it correctly. I have tried using linked list for the weights but i&#x27;m still getting segfaults. 
I&#x27;ve also been having trouble sleeping, because I&#x27;m so excited about the potential of using Cobol for neural nets.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has experience working with neural networks in Cobol, and if so, what strategies you&#x27;ve used for the forward pass and activation functions. I&#x27;m also curious about any tips or tricks you have for writing clean code in Cobol.<p>I&#x27;ve reached out a ton to the PyTorch and jax devs to see if they might be interested in helping me develop a way to transpile it to Cobol so I can use more modern techniques, but they haven&#x27;t responded to my emails.<p>Everyone on this site is on average much more polite, resourceful and ambitious compared to the other tech sites. I found this influential and I&#x27;ve been striving to demonstrate my skills by finishing a language model in COBOL, and I am almost finished I think.<p>I really thought the rigid and explcit nature of cobol would satisfy my craving for clean code. I&#x27;m the type of dev that writes 5 extra lines of python so that everyone knows what it does. But now I am getting confused with the level of verbosity, the level of explicitly has led to implicit complexity. I finally understand Turing completeness as a theoretic possibility not endless flexibility.<p>And has anyone else had success writing neural nets in Cobi? My code is getting wild out here. I&#x27;m starting to wonder if I&#x27;m in over my head here.
My develop experience and clean code is trending downward by the hour.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

During the first few months of the new job I was pretty quiet; sat back and took in the new environment. Switching from internal tools in enterprise to a team that focused on external features for a startup is a big shift and I had a lot of questions.. Probably dumb questions, but asking the dumb questions was my role as a manager :)<p>Because of the laid-back start at this new role, I&#x27;ve been seen as both the &quot;new guy&quot; and someone more junior on the team (I&#x27;m in a senior role) that consistently gets talked down to. This is after already shipping complex architecture changes in a short amount of time, taking on mentorship&#x2F;leadership roles on the team, and coming into the role with a highly technical background.<p>Due to fumbling the first couple of months at a new company, I feel like I&#x27;ve painted myself into a certain persona that&#x27;s impossible to break.
