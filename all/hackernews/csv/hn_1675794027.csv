34696330,Ask HN: Does a website's server-side WASM = “distribution” for license purposes?,2023-02-07T18:00:04Z,mattewong,1,false,false,,,,,,"Certain open-source licenses such as LGPL allow the licensed code to be compiled into a library, dynamically linked against a work compiled from closed-source code, and distributed together as a combined work, to allow the recipient to &quot;install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;lgpl-3.0.html#section4)<p>Imagine I have LGPL code &quot;OPEN.C&quot; that is compiled into static and dynamic libs &quot;OPEN.A&quot; and &quot;OPEN.DLL&quot;, and I have closed-source code that uses the library, and which is compiled into the following combined bundles:<p><pre><code>  - COMBINED_SHARED, which consists of CLOSED_SHARED.EXE and OPEN.DLL. CLOSED_SHARED.EXE dynamically links to OPEN.DLL

  - COMBINED_STATIC, which consists of CLOSED_STATIC.EXE (which was statically linked to OPEN.A at compile time)
</code></pre>
In this scenario, it seems undisputed that:<p><pre><code>  - COMBINED_SHARED can be run locally, and can also be distributed (with proper notices and adherence to other terms) without running afoul of the license

  - COMBINED_STATIC can be run locally, but cannot be distributed without running afoul of the license
</code></pre>
By &quot;run locally&quot;, I mean that the work resides on a computer, which could include a server that a user can SSH into to execute the work. In that scenario, there is only ever 1 copy of the work, even if many users are able to use it<p>But what happens if COMBINED_STATIC is a web assembly target that resides on a web server, and is one of the various resources that are served by that server to users&#x27; browsers? Is that a distribution? Has there been any legal precedent for this, or discussion of this in the open-source community, that can provide guidance?<p>Some points in favor of &quot;yes, it is a distribution&quot;:<p><pre><code>  - the web assembly (&quot;COMBINED_STATIC.wasm&quot;) is copied into the browser of each visiting user, so multiple copies are made

  - COMBINED_STATIC.wasm is executed locally inside the user&#x27;s browser, and not on the server
</code></pre>
Some points in favor of &quot;no, it is not a distribution&quot;:<p><pre><code>  - a website visitor running server-provided code is more analogous to a user who SSH&#x27;s into a server to execute code that resides there, than to a user who receives a distribution of code that the user can recombine&#x2F;relink (if given the necessary resources)

  - the user never has any ability to recombine or relink WASM that the server serves, regardless of whether the library was statically or dynamically linked, so the entire purpose of the license (to allow the recipient to &quot;install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relink&quot;) is moot and therefore the license could not be intended to apply in this situation</code></pre>",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This started because my co-founder andreterron (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=andreterron"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=andreterron</a>) and I both built personal dashboards to track different health and productivity metrics, but it’s such an annoying chore to integrate with new APIs. First you read their docs to learn their authentication method, then build and deploy a custom server to receive OAuth callback requests or deal with CORS, register an app with them, then finally you can send the first request to their API. After the initial integration is done, you now have to refresh expired tokens, make sure that you’re respecting rate limits, and update the code if the underlying API changes.<p>The solution we came up with is a proxy server, it forwards requests to the respective API with up to date auth tokens. Because of this:<p>- Devs can use the full range of capabilities of the underlying APIs.<p>- They don’t have to deal with registering OAuth apps with a ton of providers.<p>- Different API quirks are ironed out. Even if two APIs both use OAuth, there are often annoying differences in how you are required to interact with them.<p>- API Tokens are refreshed automatically if they’re expired.<p>From our conversations with other devs, there’s a lot more we want to add, like custom API providers (If we don’t support an API yet, we don’t want to block you!) and an embed-able auth component that allows your app’s users to connect their third-party accounts.<p>We’ve been really excited about the possibilities of this project for making authenticating with Third-Party APIs a little bit less painful. We’d love your feedback on the idea. What do you think of the concept? What have you built using third-party APIs? Which APIs do you want us to support in the future?",story,https://oneapikey.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
