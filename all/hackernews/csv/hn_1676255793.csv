34769292,Whats Up with Nvidia,2023-02-13T01:56:57Z,catasaurus,1,false,false,2,[34769392],,,,"I&#x27;ve been kind of conflicted lately. On one hand, Nvidia produces high end chips that meet the demand. But on the other hand, they just suck. Some of the chips you can&#x27;t even buy if your not some corporate client, or whatever you have to do to qualify. But even if you could, who in their right mind would spend 10 grand on one GPU. Because of this, the overall tech community seems to hate them because of this. But, many other places (the media,  etc) heap insane amounts of praise on them for producing &quot;cutting edge&quot; chips for AI. Can they not see how overpriced they are for everything? Even for gaming. The new 4000 series largely marketed towards gamers, is also considered insanely overpriced. They are beginning to face competition in that area, with Intel and AMD having released budget options that have come close to rivaling the    flagship Nvidia GPUs. Close. Nvidia still dominates, but how can they not realize that they are going to DIE if they do not bring down their prices. It can be done. The Intel Arc series is around 200 dollars (even less). Intel Arc does not do very well on the performance side, it runs games mostly as well as chips from a couple years ago. But still, 200 dollars? So here I ask, what the hell is up with Nvidia?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

My issue is that most of the jobs I see are web dev and I am primarily interested in lower level areas.<p>I do not see many opportunities for CS graduates interested in lower level work. A lot of the postings I do see in low level work seem to be in embedded, and desire CE and EE grads.<p>Re: embedded, I am more interested in software than hardware, but hardware does interest me, although I&#x27;d prefer to spend as much time as possible coding.<p>Basically, what areas should I look out for that might be open to new grads? I really want to find an area with lots of depth and opportunities to go deep in the stack. That is what brings me the most joy when it comes to programming.<p>Along with ideas for lower level areas, are there any project ideas one could recommend that would be interesting to work on, and that perhaps might help if included on my resume?<p>Thank you",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
