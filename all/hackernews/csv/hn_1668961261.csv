When I encounter difficult problems, I find myself brute forcing solutions in the form of trying different approaches rapidly until I get the result I want. Maybe this is happening because subconsciously I&#x27;m trying to preserve the flow I&#x27;m in, but I really don&#x27;t like this state of mind.<p>I want to be able to slow down and understand the deeper details instead of rushing towards solutions. But in the heat of the moment, it&#x27;s really hard to steer myself away from a tight feedback loop.<p>As a side note, I&#x27;m aware of countless programmer memes which depict similar behavior i.e. &quot;choosing X hours of debugging instead of reading 2 pages of documentation&quot;. So maybe I&#x27;m not the only one. Do you experience similar issues?
