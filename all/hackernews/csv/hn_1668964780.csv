Fortunately, as yet this is a fate which most people escape through their obscurity; but as publicity gets more and more perfect in its methods, there will be an increasing danger in this novel form of social persecution. This is too grave a matter to be treated with disdain by the individual who is its victim, and whatever may be thought of the great principle of the freedom of the press, I think the line will have to be drawn more sharply than it is by the existing libel laws, and anything will have to be forbidden that makes life intolerable for innocent individuals, even if they should happen to have done or said things which, published maliciously, can cause them to become unpopular. The only ultimate cure for this evil is, however, an increase of toleration on the part of the public.

I&#x27;ve found it surprisingly challenging to reason about how much altruism I should hope to achieve. Sometimes it feels like being the most helpful is at-odds with developing the strongest possible business model.<p>As a more concrete example, let&#x27;s say I am creating some software to help people with their mental health journey.<p>What market do I target? At a high level, two options come to mind:<p>- Those who have identified a want for mental health assistance, are currently suffering, and are searching for tools to mitigate.<p>- Those who have not identified a want for mental health assistance, are currently suffering, and are worsening.<p>Objectively, I am far more interested and concerned for those in the latter group. They are in a more vulnerable position and stand to benefit more from my efforts, but they are also more difficult to sell solutions. The former is looking to be sold, which is alluring, but I am not as worried for them because they have enough self-awareness to identify their personal needs and are seeking solutions.<p>In talking to people, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that a solution for one group will look markedly different than a solution for the other. Those seeking assistance expect self-help language to exist in the software and are emboldened by it, but, conversely, those not yet searching are repulsed by the direct language and need a softer approach. It doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to dedicate an MVP to the former market with the hope of pivoting to encompass the latter.<p>My gut says capitalism is too ruthless to tolerate pursuit of the less valuable market for an MVP and that the only viable approach is to chase the money and then, once ~stable, tolerate losses in the pursuit of rebalancing the business model more towards altruism.<p>Does that sound right to you? What comes to your mind when you consider the difficulties in balancing altruism with a strong business model?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
