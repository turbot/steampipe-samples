35357382,"Show HN: Use GPT4 to quickly build simple, shareable web apps",2023-03-29T13:59:53Z,abi,3,false,false,,,,,,"Hi everyone,<p>I built a quick experiment last weekend that allows you to use GPT4 to quickly generate single page web apps. These apps are immediately deployed at a shareable and bookmark-able web URL.<p>Even though I’m a programmer, I think the idea of letting users build little apps without coding to solve their own problems is super exciting. I specifically built this because I wanted to solve a tiny problem of mine. I have a goal of running 500 miles this year. I track my runs on Strava and it shows me the total number of miles for the year. But I wanted to know: how many miles should I have run by this point in the year to be on track? I prompted and iterated with Pico and a few mins, I had a simple app: [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backend-pico.onrender.com&#x2F;gender-hybrid](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backend-pico.onrender.com&#x2F;gender-hybrid)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backend-pico.onrender.com&#x2F;gender-hybrid](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bac...</a> that I could add to my iPhone home screen.<p>The apps built by Pico have lots of limitations (single page, can only use HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;vanilla JS + popular JS libraries) but they can also be incredibly powerful and surprisingly useful sometimes. And sometimes, Pico will completely fail to generate anything useful :(<p>Here are some fun things you can build:<p>* Wordle, Tic Tac Toe, any simple game.<p>* TODO list.<p>* Daily affirmations&#x2F;horoscope.<p>* Camera filter app<p>* Audio recorder and processor<p>* “App for lumberjacks”<p>See website for demo apps.<p>I would love to hear your feedback and see what you build with Pico.",story,https://picoapps.xyz/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
