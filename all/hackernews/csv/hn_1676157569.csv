34757396,Ask HN: Should I change from a shared office to a solo office?,2023-02-11T23:10:08Z,leinkasorafkt,1,false,false,,,,,,"I have been sharing a two person office with the same coworker for about a decade.<p>We aren&#x27;t that close and vibe pretty well otherwise, as we are both low-energy and don&#x27;t need much talk amongst us.<p>I attend maybe 1 meeting a day, whereas my coworker is a project manager who has as many as 7-8 a day, sometimes leading them.<p>Pre-covid all of these meetings were physical.<p>After covid it&#x27;s become unbearable because every meeting my coworker and I have is on Teams&#x2F;Zoom, where before they were in physical meeting rooms, which gave me natural breathers during the day. So my meetings are in effect also attended by the coworker.<p>The coworker has also had a persistent cough since covid, with maybe 100 smaller coughs throughout the day. I&#x27;m chronically conflict avoidant so I&#x27;m not going to bring that up, because I think one would stop coughing if able to.<p>There is hardly a single minute where I am able to concentrate, hear my own thoughts, etc. these past few years when at the office.<p>A solo office nearby has become vacant, but I feel like somehow I would regret it if I changed.<p>Thoughts?<p>Note: I work remotely sometimes (1-2 days a week), but I enjoy being on-site besides constant interruptions and noise in the office. Physical meetings, talk at the coffee machine &#x2F; kitchen, etc. are nice.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
