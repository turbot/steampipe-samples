Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.<p>I used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.<p>Some examples:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@anht_59851&#x2F;html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd<p>These still exist, but there are problems with them:<p>1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There&#x27;s no &quot;inspect&quot; panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.<p>2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. &quot;let&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to work, not does &quot;addEventListener,&quot; etc. I kept getting weird &quot;Syntax Errors&quot; for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.<p>3. I&#x27;m quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.<p>What&#x27;s the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.<p>I essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.<p>What am I looking for?
