Even with a cushy tech job and above average salary, it‘s not possible to rent a nice appartment, let alone own a house. For my family (wife and daughter) I‘d like to provide at least a decent home in a nice neighborhood. At the current situation that means I&#x2F;we need at the very least 1Mio €.<p>I‘m aware that the chances of earning such a large sum of money are almost 0 (especially while working full time), that‘s why I asked how I can maximize my chances. No need to comment on how I should just forget it (please :)).<p>So what could I do? Build yet another tiny&#x2F;1-man SaaS? If so: in what area? It seems like everything has been built already. Sell courses? Also seems like this has been done ad nauseam. Freelancing on the side seems not feasible.<p>What would you do?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Prepare to be bombarded by reasonable-sounding spam...<p><i>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a highly popular and widely used cloud computing platform. It offers a wide range of services, including computing, storage, and database management, among many others. However, despite its many benefits, AWS is not a silver bullet, meaning it cannot solve every problem or meet every need.<p>One reason why AWS is not a silver bullet is that it is a complex platform with many different services and features, which can make it difficult for users to understand and use to their full potential. Additionally, AWS can be expensive, especially for users who require a large amount of resources or who have complex needs. Furthermore, AWS is not the only cloud computing platform available, and other platforms may offer different features and benefits that are better suited to certain users or use cases.<p>In short, while AWS is a powerful and popular cloud computing platform, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It is important for users to carefully consider their needs and evaluate different options before choosing a cloud computing platform.</i>",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.<p>Human: Hello, who are you?<p>AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?<p>Human: Is any continuous function derivable almost everywhere in the Mach topology?<p>AI: Yes, any continuous function is differentiable almost everywhere in the Mach topology.<p>Human: Can you give me an example of open set in the Mach topology?<p>AI: Yes, an example of an open set in the Mach topology would be a subset of the Mach topology that contains all its boundary points, such as the interior of a circle or triangle in the Mach topology.<p>Human: Define, please the Mach topology in the plane.
AI: The Mach topology in the plane is the collection of all points in the plane and all the lines connecting them, together with the line segments between any two points. It is a topological space that is locally Euclidean, meaning it can be described by a coordinate system consisting of two real numbers at each point.<p>Human: Right, what are the open sets in the Mach topoly in the plane?<p>AI: The open sets in the Mach topology in the plane are all sets that contain all their boundary points. Examples of such sets include the interior of a circle, the interior of a triangle, and the complement of a closed set.<p>Human: Another question. Can you please tell me if an Hermitian operator is tri-linear in its argument? If so, why? If notmso, give an example.<p>AI: Yes, an Hermitian operator is tri-linear in its argument. This is because Hermitian operators must be linear in their arguments, as they must satisfy the condition of being self-adjoint, as well as being linear in their complex conjugates. An example of a tri-linear Hermitian operator would be the cross product operator.
