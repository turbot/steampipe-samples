The discourse around these technologies is quite hyperbolic and free of the more rational, reserved expectations and reasoned discussion I might expect to find around technological developments. Companies seem to be rushing to shove chat AIs into absolutely everything, even where it doesn&#x27;t make much sense, just to get a blog post out at the detriment of their products.

we made a site that gets GPT to answer your question using the info on a webpage you specify or document you upload (e.g., a large textbook .pdf file).<p>Background:
When ChatGPT came out, I had the idea of having it pull answers from my stereo receiver&#x27;s annoyingly dense 32 page manual. My weekend project prototype proceeded to surprise with great answers—just like what we&#x27;ve all experienced by now. My co-founder thought we should productize it, and make it easy to use online. So here we are with a very early beta! (Try it on a HN thread...)",story,https://klavier.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
