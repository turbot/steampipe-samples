34943837,Ask HN: How to develop a first-principles understanding of CS,2023-02-26T07:46:04Z,platforms72,1,false,false,1,[34943951],,,,"Hi HN,<p>Current sophomore studying CS -- I&#x27;ve been thinking about how to get a deeper understanding of what I&#x27;m studying, and how to self-study the topics I&#x27;m interested in more intentionally.<p>Sometimes, it feels like I don&#x27;t remember the content I learned in a class the quarter after I took them. I&#x27;ll certainly recall general ideas&#x2F;concepts, but I feel I&#x27;m missing two things -- first, a very strong sense of how to apply what I learn, and second, some of the important minutia (is big endian stored back to front or front to back? how do I structure and inductive proof? etc).<p>These are things I can look up quite quickly, and aren&#x27;t the best examples of what I should be optimizing for if I&#x27;m looking to work in a traditional software engineering context, but I feel like I should know them off hand. I&#x27;ve looked into spaced repetition for memorizing certain things, but I feel like that doesn&#x27;t get help with what I&#x27;m seeking here, which is a foundational&#x2F;first-principles understanding of CS.<p>This was all somewhat prompted by this comment on reddit -- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;computervision&#x2F;comments&#x2F;7gku4z&#x2F;comment&#x2F;dqkkbd9&#x2F;?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3. I was daunted by these questions, but it feels like I could answer them if my understanding of certain things went beyond a surface level (i.e. integer overflow).<p>My ask(s) are these -- first, do you have any recommended books&#x2F;resources that did a lot for you in developing a foundational understanding of CS, second, how should I go about intentionally filling gaps in my understanding, and third, how can I get better at being able to apply what I&#x27;ve learned to a new problem&#x2F;setting.<p>Apologies for the long, rambly post in advance. I truly appreciate you reading this, please let me know if you have any clarifying questions.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
