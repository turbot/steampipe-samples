I have essentially zero faith that this will lead to better outcomes for most people. Instead I expect a massive new consolidation of wealth, and a lot of new misery for many people put out of work by AI.

I removed the NSFW filter so be mindful of your prompts!&quot;<p>I originally posted this (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32696866) when SD 1.4 had just been released, and it was a very clunky PoC running off of a Google Colab Pro notebook. Currently running off Genesis Cloud and spending a decent chunk of change to keep it running. I just upgraded the model being used from SD v1.4 to SD v2.1, and the upgrade is definitely an interesting sight to behold. If you would like early access to new features (such as img2img, coming next week) as well as unlimited (up to 2000 images a day) image generations, please consider upgrading on the sms2img.com page. Please use the same number as the one you are texting in from as I intend to use that as a verification method.<p>For now, it is still free to use, but in order to continue running this, I will need to get more serious about at least paying for the costs to host this. I will be limiting to 3 image generations per day for free users starting in the very near future. Thank you! Please enjoy :)<p>Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get into the AI Grant batch but decided to continue working on it.

I don&#x27;t have so much experience with web development (haven&#x27;t used any front-end framework before), but I was messing around with some PHP&#x2F;Laravel for (almost) the last year.<p>would you encourage me to go with this Idea? or you have another suggestion? if yes, which database do you think a should use? a relational (I&#x27;m a bit comfortable with Postgres) or some non relational (MongoDB). also if I want to put this in a micro-services format, how do I split up my services (like submissions, profiles...) I am new to this.
I&#x27;m asking about which database since the mentioned stack is terminated by my school, but not the database.<p>as I said, the purpose of this project is education purposes only (also to show off on my resume&#x2F;portfolio).<p>Thanks in advance",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
