I have a drone, a 360 action camera, a mirrorless camera, a phone - I took a lot of photos and video. There is no commercial background therefore I don&#x27;t want to spend $$$ on TB of storage. And internet bandwidth usually not so good to upload everything immediately. Therefore I am using the following setup.<p>Traveler Storage:<p>1. Single Board Computer (Raspberry PI) with armbian on the board.
2. External 5TB HDD from Costco.
3. Automount and autobackup script.
4. gocryptfs (but key is not stored securely currently on my side).
5. Resilio Sync to backup all my data to the remote storage<p>I connect it to the Etherenet and put into USB power supplier when I traveling. I am thinking to create some app for Android that can connect over Bluetooth and send WiFi password to connect to wifi network instead of dealing with Ethernet.<p>Remote Storage setup:
1. Single Board Computer (RPi4) with Armbian
2. External 5TB HDD.
3. Resilio Sync to backup media files from the &quot;Traveler Storage&quot;.
4. Tailscale to be able to connect remotely.<p>Questions:
1. Is there a better alternative to my setup? Especially for hotels when internet are really bad?
2. If no, do creators need this thing to be in production? Does it make sense to start a kickstarter company?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Customers still need to review each transaction to assign a category, vendor, department, and tax code.<p>With the Strada API, you can offer accounting integrations, cleanse your transaction data, and automatically map transaction details based on each customer’s accounting setup.<p>We’d love any feedback you have.
