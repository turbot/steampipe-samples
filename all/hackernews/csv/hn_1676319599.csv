Our current loop is React-based, we give them a view of what their page should look like, test that they can design some semi-complex state to make the page function correctly. We give them 3 hours to solve it, with checkins each hour for them to ask questions and show their progress. It’s a relatively simple app to build, and we let them choose their component library.<p>But we’re struggling to get good signal. In many cases, the candidate’s code has multiple issues, though it’s often not clear whether they would be able to fix it with a bit more time or if it’s core misunderstandings about how to write good frontend.<p>We’ve debated making it an unlimited-time takehome, but we worry that this is disrespectful of a candidate’s time. We are sympathetic to candidates who are doing many of these interviews for different companies. We do know that there’s the option to pay candidate’s for their time - but we are still hesitant on doing a takehome for other reasons, for example it’s hard to compare an engineer who takes a full weekend to complete a takehome, versus someone who submits it within an hour.<p>Additionally, we find some value in the check-ins, to see the candidate’s thought process.<p>So far, though, we’ve had no luck with the current structure, so we’re looking to refactor it completely.<p>So my question for HN: how do you structure your frontend loops?
