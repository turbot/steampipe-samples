The opposite of that is Stack Overflow, which in an attempt to avoid decrease in quality, established itself as a toxic over moderated community, where almost everything gets downvoted and closed, and if not, edited to be so far from the original post that the entire question changes. As opposed to Reddit, which is so full of superficial fluff and under moderation that it is more of a place were people go for like&#x2F;upvotes&#x2F;karma. Not for discussing or creating something of actual value. So I ask, do you think it is possible for an online community to keep itself in that sweet spot between Reddit and Stack Overflow for as long as it is relevant? Also, where is Hn in that spectrum?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
