I&#x27;m looking the solution that requires the least effort to creating an MVP of this project.<p>Summary: &quot;Send push notification when a new software&#x2F;package version is available&quot;.<p>Parts needed (as far as I can imagine):
- Simple website for accounts&#x2F;signups and managing of preferences (for which software&#x2F;packages to receive notifications for).
- Backend for checking RSS feeds, json files, or scraping simple websites to check software&#x2F;packages&#x27; latest versions.
- Payment&#x2F;billing system.
- Mobile app for users to receive push notifications
- Push notification service<p>I&#x27;ve played around with IFTTT and Zapier to create some simple prototypes but to glue all the parts together seems like a daunting task, especially considering how little time I have.<p>I&#x27;ve also looked around on Upwork to find the right 1-2 developers to develop this for me but haven&#x27;t found anyone I can feel that I can trust.<p>Looking forward to any advice&#x2F;feedback.

Unfortunately, the website tells you very little and forces you to enter your card to create an account&#x2F;see its full capabilities.<p>The &#x27;Sign up&#x27; page clearly states &#x27;The first week is free.

However, some comments on Twitter are concerning as they suggest the platform keeps charging them after cancelling, with no response contacting the Svbtle support email and owner of the platform (@dcurtis). For instance, see this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;cterickson&#x2F;status&#x2F;1523997786542428163#m<p>So, thought I&#x27;d write this as a warning and to find out if anybody here has encountered similar problems.<p>And before anybody says &#x27;should&#x27;ve used a virtual card&#x27;, they&#x27;re less accessible in the UK.
