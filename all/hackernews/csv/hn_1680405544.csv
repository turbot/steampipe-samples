35406779,Ask HN: Windows Dev Kit 2023: Impressions 5 months in?,2023-04-02T03:12:17Z,jmmv,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello!<p>Back when Project Volterra launched, I was very tempted to get one of these devices but the stock ran out quickly. I see that the device is back in stock now so, once again, I&#x27;m tempted to buy one :)<p>For context: In my case, I would be using the device as my primary desktop. My workflow is mostly to SSH into a powerful machine I have in the garage via a terminal and VSCode, so the device on my desk doesn&#x27;t matter that much really. I occasionally use Lightroom and the Office apps, and have a couple of ancient games in Steam. I specifically do not target Windows nor arm64 in my development (yet?), but having what seems to be a snappy and power-efficient little device on my desk for a good price sounds neat. Yeah, getting one of these would mostly be a cool-factor kind of purchase...<p>For extra context, this would be replacing a Mac Pro 2013 (the 6-core trashcan) that I have running Windows 11 natively. I&#x27;ve been trying to research what the performance differences would be but it&#x27;s really hard to compare such an old device with this newer arm64-based machine. Oh, and it would be hooked to a 4K monitor via DP, but that seems to be fine as far as I can tell.<p>The question to you is: if you have been using one of these devices for the past few months, what are your impressions overall now that the hype has cooled off?<p>And... any new developments on running Linux on this thing? The internet seems kinda quiet about this topic... but given that both FreeBSD and OpenBSD seem to run on it, it&#x27;s hard to believe that Linux doesn&#x27;t at all yet.<p>Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I then remembered that calendar exports were just a few clicks away in the .ics format, so I decided to use that instead.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find anything online other than half broken scripts or language-specific libraries to parse .ics files, so I then went ahead and wrote a straight forward, pure bash implementation for CLI usage.<p>Hope this is useful for others as well!<p>I put in a few examples to try out in the readme on Github, let me know if you try it out!",story,https://github.com/loteoo/icsp,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;d really like to have a read only token that could be issued by my bank so I can have a little web client pull the balance data and update a budget for me. Yes I know there&#x27;s mint budgeting and all that. I&#x27;m skeptical of handing the keys over to others and I&#x27;d like to DIY this. Is there some regulatory reason this doesn&#x27;t exist? Are there any banks that have API access that clients can&#x27;t use? Every time I switch banks to something that has cash envelope accounting they take it away or merge with another bank and I have to start the whole process over again. I&#x27;m beginning to think it would be easier to just do it myself if I had API access.,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
