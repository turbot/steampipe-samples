34863295,Ask HN: Have you ever taken a chance on someone and it didn't work out?,2023-02-20T00:05:06Z,mattbgates,2,false,false,1,[34863381],,,,"I&#x27;ve heard of many success stories of someone taking a chance on someone else, either giving them money, a place to stay for a reasonable price, or even sponsoring their education, and that person turning their life around. But I&#x27;ve encountered the opposite: everyone I&#x27;ve taken a chance on has disappointed me, taking advantage of the opportunity I provided for them, or it just ended up not working out the way I thought it would.<p>Recently, a childhood friend of mine was down in the dust, and had his criminal record expunged for marijuana possession (jailed for being near a school) since it&#x27;s technically not a crime anymore. It was just a case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. People aren&#x27;t the same as they age, though there is a general part of their personality that usually always stays the same, but when I was younger, he 
 encouraged me to not allow myself to be bullied, so he&#x27;s a guy I looked up to. My mother also babysat him and his sister. So he wasn&#x27;t a complete stranger to me.<p>I offered him a place to stay on the condition that he get a job and pay his rent. I&#x27;m a contract man so I wrote up the contract and we both signed it. He&#x27;s been a good roommate as far as one could ask for.. quiet, kept to himself, cleaned up after himself, and was paying his rent up until a month ago. He&#x27;d been living with me for just 4 months. I don&#x27;t know what happened, but it was like he just decided one day he wasn&#x27;t going to work or pay rent anymore, and I approached him with an eviction notice: pay up or get out. I thought I was helping someone out but ended up just getting screwed by thinking he wanted to better his life.<p>Care to share your stories?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34863035,Ask HN: Legal Entity for Personal Projects?,2023-02-19T23:36:15Z,ynterlude,1,false,false,1,[34863058],,,,"In a few weeks, I&#x27;ll be taking a break from having a full-time job to scratch the itch of trying to build a bunch of ideas that have been rattling around my head for years.<p>There are a few logistical things that I&#x27;m concerned about getting into trouble with:<p>1. Running afoul of government regulations (Cookie banner requirements, CCPA, etc.)
I know many of these wouldn&#x27;t actually apply to a tiny personal project, but as there are greater numbers of tech regulations I&#x27;m worried there will be some legal requirement I fail to comply with due to ignorance or incompetence. (The latter is a real risk--though I studied CS in college, I&#x27;ve never coded professionally outside of internships).<p>2. Personal liability if I&#x27;m sued
This one&#x27;s particularly on my mind since several of the ideas I want to explore involve scraping data from sites that may object, but I can come up with all kinds of nightmare scenarios outside of that. I wouldn&#x27;t want some dumb little project I&#x27;m playing around with to end up bankrupting me.<p>3. Running up massive cloud provider bills
Just heard too many horror stories about this, and again my incompetence is a big risk.<p>Wondering if there are well-established ways that folks have dealt with these issues, e.g., creating a separate legal entity like an LLC and&#x2F;or creating a separate bank account. To be clear, I&#x27;m not specifically trying to start a company. I&#x27;d love it if I some of the things I build could be self-sustaining, but I&#x27;m very cognizant of the fact that the most likely outcome is that anything I build is completely ignored.<p>Since jurisdiction probably matters, I&#x27;m based in California.<p>Appreciate any advice or thoughts folks have!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34863338,Ask HN: Query about local-first web development,2023-02-20T00:11:24Z,forestrat,1,false,false,,,,,,"This is related to recent discussion earlier today in HN about local-first development - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34857435<p>Local-first web development seems to be something which I need for solving a problem which I am facing, ALMOST!!<p>It will be great if someone here guides me on how I can solve this below problem.<p>I am part of a Enterprise company which installs a bunch of managed security softwares in employees&#x27; laptops. A couple of these security softwares can&#x2F;must be used in BYODs as well, to connect to the company network.<p>I would like to build a application such that, whenever a employee finds that something is not working right on their laptop, they should be able to fire it up on their browser and it will access logs from these security software and does troubleshooting&#x2F;debugging locally on the machine and provides the results and remediation steps to the person. This will tremendously save time instead of contacting IT team and waiting for their help.<p>For this usecase, I have some limitations.<p>1) I want to be able to solve for both managed laptops and BYODs (both Mac and Windows). So I cannot push this as a desktop application using MDM solution.<p>I want this to be a web-app as I can control the version of the application that they are running. So a local-first web app seems perfect in that sense.<p>2) I want to be able to access local file system where the logs of these security software are located. I am not a developer, but rather a infra guy, but based on what I know, a web-app cannot access the file system without user actually doing a file picker. But in this case, it is too much friction for non-technical users, especially since I want to build this solution for multiple security software which is dependent on multiple file location.<p>3) Moreover, I don&#x27;t want to unnnecessarily reveal too much information of location of the log files for the security softwares. But if it is a local-first &quot;web-app&quot; and the user has to be pick the file using a dialog box, I cannot do it without revealing the location.<p>4) For &quot;some&quot; use cases, I want to be able to &quot;securely&quot; send meta data to a centralized server for more complex troubleshooting scenarios or to log a ticket, for example.<p>Can someone please give me pointers on how I can solve this?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
