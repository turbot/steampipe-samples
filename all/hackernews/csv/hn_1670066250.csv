I really wanted to do the right thing for the users. The driving principles were as follows:<p>- Privacy. These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.<p>- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.<p>- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.<p>- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.<p>- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.<p>- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.<p>- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there&#x27;s a bug, just report it.<p>- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.<p>I&#x27;ve used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn&#x27;re really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.<p>So, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Self-hosted is not what I&#x27;m looking for, and neither are tools to build docs.
