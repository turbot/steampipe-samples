I really enjoy working with the scrum process, however, most product owners care relatively less if stories are well written and have no problems refining them over and over again.
That&#x27;s where I saw potential: I built (yet another, I have to say regarding shownew) a website that uses the OpenAI API to generate scrum stories based on a project description and a short idea description. It works fairly well, but I would love to hear feedback from others than co-employees, and this is the only place I know to get some valuable early feedback.<p>The website does not require any sign up, has no paid model, and I am really doing this &quot;advertisement&quot; only to get some feedback of any kind.
The landing page is <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storygenie.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storygenie.io</a>, the app itself is also directly accessible in a demo format under <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.storygenie.io&#x2F;demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.storygenie.io&#x2F;demo</a> :)<p>Thank you for any feedback and greetings from Germany!
