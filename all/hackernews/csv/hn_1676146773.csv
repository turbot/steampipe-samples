34755376,Ask HN: Worth submitting a pull request to add –dry-run flag to rm?,2023-02-11T19:20:33Z,logicallee,2,false,false,,,,,,"Is it worth submitting a high-quality pull request to add a --dry-run flag to the basic Linux rm command (rm --dry-run -rf), so users can quickly preview all files that will be deleted before actually executing the command? The current workaround of piping yes n to rm -i is not a perfect solution and doesn&#x27;t match rm&#x27;s behavior because it asks if you want to descend into a directory, which requires y, nor do several other workarounds (find, ls, etc) match its behavior exactly. I&#x27;ve contributed to open source but haven&#x27;t contributed to Linux source code before but I think adding this flag would benefit users.<p>Would a pull request like this be rejected or have a chance of being merged?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

In a scenario where one needs hundreds of scrapers all grabbing the same five or 10 pieces of information (dates, names, addresses, and ID numbers) is it possible to just grab the raw HTML and train an NLP model to find the relevant data rather than selecting specific selectors&#x2F;paths?<p>It seems to me that finding these items in an HTML doc would be a trivial task for NLP and this would allow us to forgo scraper maintenance in the event that websites change.
