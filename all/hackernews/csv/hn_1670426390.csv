Those numbers started getting expensive. This prompted me to try and set up a new server cluster using IPv6 exclusively, and see how far I could get before having to give in and purchase an additional v4 address.<p>The experiment ended much sooner than I had anticipated. Some of the road blocks I hit along the way:<p><pre><code>  - The GitHub API and its code load endpoints are not reachable via IPv6, making it impossible to download release artefacts from many projects, lots of which distribute their software via GitHub exclusively (Prometheus for instance).
  - The default Ubuntu key servers aren&#x27;t reachable via IPv6, making it difficult to install packages from third-party registries, such as Docker or Grafana. While debugging, I noticed huge swaths of the GPG infrastructure are defunct: There aren&#x27;t many key servers left at all, and the only one I found actually working via IPv6 was pgpkeys.eu.
  - BitBucket cannot deploy to IPv6 hosts, as pipelines don&#x27;t support IPv6 at all. You can self-host a pipeline runner and connect to it via v6, BUT it needs to have a dual stack - otherwise the runner won&#x27;t start.
  - Hetzner itself doesn&#x27;t even provide their own API via IPv6 (which we talk to for in-cluster service discovery. Oh, the irony.

Particularly if you didn’t get funded how did it impact your career? Was it a good use of your time and (lack of) money?<p>I would be joining as a founder without a startup, which makes the whole thing less “driven”. I mean startups pivot all the time so it’s not these relevant but it worries me slightly to be joining without any clear purpose other than “finding a match”. I guess I should look at it like a free “Master in Startups”.<p>I’m particularly curious about the network and the opportunity for people who “failed” the first stage and didn’t get founded. Or got funded but burned through the 80k and didn’t manage to raise any more money.<p>What was life after that? Did you get hired by a fellow cofounder from your cohort? Did you get hired by Antler past companies? Did you wonder the land without a penny to your name?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
