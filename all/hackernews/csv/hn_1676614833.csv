34831098,Show HN: I made an extension for ChatGPT that lets you track changes,2023-02-17T05:22:17Z,shuafeiwang,1,false,false,,,,,,"I’ve been using this for my own workflow and friends suggested I share it with them so I quickly threw together my first chrome extension! As an ex-editor, I think chatGPT is overlooked as an editor with everyone jumping straight into writing. Editing is essentially giving it as comprehensive a writing prompt as possible. Playing with the actual prompt also gets you a wide range of different results that grammarly&#x2F;other apps cant really do. The x% has been changed tool was the first thing I built to see how intrusive chatGPT&#x27;s editing was at a glance. My biggest struggle was trying to limit chatGPT from doing too much.<p>Some example prompts<p>Proofread this but only fix grammar: (10% change)<p>Proofread this: (20-30% change)<p>Proofread this, lightly improving clarity and flow: (30-40% change)<p>Proofread this, improving clarity and flow: (30-50% change)<p>Proofread this, significantly improving clarity and flow: (40-60% change)<p>Proofread these 5 bullet points: (you sometimes have to specify this otherwise it turns it into a paragraph)<p>Proofread these 4 bullet points from my CV, keep it in CV language: (helps prevent it from adding personal pronouns)",story,https://www.editgpt.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
