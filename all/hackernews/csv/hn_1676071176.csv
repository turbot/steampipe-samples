Scrapers are deployed on VMs, launching scrapy crawler instances dynamically based on feed SLA data in the db; there is no “scheduler”, but rather long-running parent coordinators launching child subprocesses as needed, so SLAs (and other attributes) can be modified by site admins without touching spiders",story,https://feedgrid.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
