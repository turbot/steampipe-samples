I know they always talk about two things: 1- talking to customers, 2- building the product.
Ok, I&#x27;m doing both of them in my startup and have done everything well. Now we have over 100 people who really love our product and care about it, even doing many things voluntarily for it in their country, creating content and introducing us to others. Also, I&#x27;ll introduce it in the following.<p>Our focus is on the B2B2C model (some none-inflationary CAC sales channels[1]) instead of paid channels (we can&#x27;t afford), it needs trust, and for an agency in NY trust comes from searching and seeing an article about us in NYT, WSJ,... or raised funds in Crunchbase.<p>Introduce myself:<p>I&#x27;m a developer, electronic eng and in my 20th I created a way to pre-train MLPs with low entropy datasets and other bs. Now I&#x27;m 35. During this time I worked hard to find a way to collect the fund I needed to create my AI lab and work on it. But there was one problem I have Iranian nationality, and I had to move to another country because of sanctions, no access to international banking, and so on - Now I&#x27;m in Denmark.<p>My question is: 
So what the next? I&#x27;m open to any ideas.<p>About my product:<p>Let me introduce our platform; Selldone.com; our users can create a storefront and we give them an online back-office to manage their businesses. So far it is similar to Shopify, But the most distinctive thing is that it does not have &#x27;any plugins&#x27; or &#x27;templates&#x27;. Our ultimate goal is to remove humans from repetitive workflows with automation and AI.<p>Selldone (SD) has over 2K active shops (start using within the last 4 months) + 500 paid merchants in the US, UK, Australia, Europe, Korea, Nepal, China, and many other countries. They use selldone as a marketplace builder. Platforms (like Shopify)  have two problems in expanding in the markets outside of North America: 1- local payments and 2- regulatory compliance [2]. 
We can solve these problems for any country, and deploy and run selldone locally in any region within 48 hours.<p>If you like to know more: [some thoughts and plans]<p>There are +300M SMEs, and +100M home businesses worldwide. What I&#x27;m seeing is the high adoption of selldone by users who are getting started with it, and we&#x27;re also following the B2B2C model, which provides a great opportunity for partnerships. What we need are ways to 1. put selldone in front of agencies and freelancers, 2. create trust by influencers&#x27; distribution strategy, and 3. focus on compatibility with local regulatory compliance concerns.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;escaping-hells-flywheel-building-non-inflationary-distribution-channels&#x2F;<p>[2] A customer concern in Germany in our chat:

Plus preferentially 4 processor cores and hard enough (and easy to dismantle) casing.<p>I already have a cheap HP 250 G6, which computationally works decently, but has a cooler fan replaced (with 3 mo of warranty) and some plastic fixing the display bezel screws broken. I don&#x27;t know if I won&#x27;t break it even more upon repair&#x2F;attaching glue (the probability of which is ~20-10%).<p>There&#x27;s some review of a similar Dell laptop here [1]. I want to run at least Python, C&#x2F;C++, machine learning, Blender and other CADs, data analysis on this laptop. The Dell Vostro 3510 (Core i5-1135G7&#x2F;8GB&#x2F;256GB SSD&#x2F;15.6&quot; FHD&#x2F;Intel UHD&#x2F;Cam &amp; Mic&#x2F;WLAN + BT&#x2F; US Backlit Kb&#x2F;3 Cell&#x2F;Ubuntu) with 4cores&#x2F;8 threads, 2.40GHz, 4.20 GHz max seems decent. It has Ubuntu preinstalled and I do not want to pay for Windows, which I will eventually erase for Linux. But it seems to have a feeble casing, though on the Dell website for this laptop Dell writes that it has a hard plastic.<p>My budget is around 500 euros, 400 would be ideal. But for 400 there is a similar Lenovo laptop with DOS and some metal casing at the local store (eastern EU), which has only a 1 year warranty vs 3 years for Dell. On laptop media there&#x27;s also information that Asus Expertbook series has a fortified casing, but all ASUS&#x27;es here come with Windows.<p>Is this Dell laptop decent for beginners to start long programming sessions?

33607317,Show HN: A crypto social trading platform that improves Etoro's copy-trade model,2022-11-15T10:07:38Z,tordess,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN,<p>I was watching an interview of Caroline Ellison (CEO of Alameda Research) the other day and found it interesting that she never uses stoploss (no wonder shit happened). One of the most important skills for traders is how to set up stoploss and stick to it when stoploss is about to hit. I see that most crypto traders don&#x27;t follow this principle.<p>There is a huge demand for social trading (similar to Etoro) from crypto traders. Fact: 76.2% crypto traders surveyed say that they want to have social trading (copy-trade) features - Source: Statista (2021). There have been multiple attempts from various crypto start-ups (including the ones backed by major crypto exchanges such as Binance or Bybit) trying to build Etoro-equivalent for crypto.<p>However, due to the volatile nature of crypto markets, most of the top traders on such platforms are pure gamblers, who may have luck once in a while. Most of the copiers there cannot obtain sustainable profits from copying the top traders. Users do not enjoy similar benefits of copy-trading as the ones on Etoro.
A personal story: I was once a top trader at a crypto social trading platform (Zignaly), attracted some substantial funding from copiers, but later get myself (together with the copiers) liquidated.<p>I recently found out about prop-trade platforms such as Topstep &amp; FTMO. This is a proven business model in forex &amp; stock trading with multiple platforms having 100k+ active users. These platforms evaluate day traders’ performance in real-time simulated accounts, in which those who pass the evaluation&#x2F;challenge earn a funded trading account (while still being monitored against its max drawdown rule).<p>I realized that prop-trade challenge can be integrated with copy-trade functions and fix the problem of the existing crypto social trading platforms. That&#x27;s why I built Tordess (a “misspelling” of tortoise).<p>We launched our MVP (open-beta) on October 15th, acquired 700+ beta users&#x2F;testers as of today and secured affiliate partnership with 2 major Vietnamese crypto trading &amp; prop-trade (Facebook) groups that have more than 200 thousand members.<p>Since launch, several top traders on our platform have produced 100%+ return on simulated accounts, without breaking our rule of maximum 10% drawdown. While it is amazing how talented retail traders are able to achieve such results in crypto bear market, it also shows the potential of fixing social trading (copy-trade) model by combining prop-trade challenges.<p>If these resonate with you, then give Tordess a try. Our competition mode is always for free.<p>Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!",story,https://tordess.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
