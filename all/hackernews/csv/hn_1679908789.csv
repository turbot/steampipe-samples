2. to include lines and a title
3. prompts to draw it<p>I&#x27;m asking ChatGPT to output JSON with the comic and then I parse it and move it to the next step of the pipeline (drawing). Tools on their own are cool, but chaining them is the true multiplier of creativity.<p>Check the source on Github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;infomiho&#x2F;dailyaicomics<p>The hardest thing so far was figuring out how to get a bit more consistent style since each panel is draw in isolation. 
I&#x27;ve tried asking &quot;draw in the style of X famous comic writer&quot; but that had two drawbacks:
- their style varies (color, black and white)
- since it&#x27;s a comic author, it oftentimes draws a whole comic (multiple panels)<p>Now I&#x27;m being very explicit around the style (ink, pastel colors etc.) and it&#x27;s okay.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what&#x27;s the best approach to get consistency?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35324485,SaaS for Realtime/AI data cleaning and summarizing (Need feedback),2023-03-27T09:06:15Z,amoltakkalki66,1,false,false,1,[35324492],,,,"Hello all,
Applying for YC S23, how does the 1 liner sound. Here is more on the same. Let me know if the above helps justify what it is doing.<p>Problem: unclean data goes without any intervention for a long time. So it will take space &amp; also no value is generated.
Our solution: will act as a crawler&#x2F;filter to store only what has value
Definition of value: it is like what is statistically significant<p>So what I am building is a SaaS that will do all the preparation before an analyst starts his work. Just like a chef gets his veggies chopped before he starts. 
So an analyst has to do 3 steps primarily 
1. Gather data
2. Clean data
3. Do the exploratory or initial statistical analysis 
My SaaS helps in steps 2 &amp; 3. Also it will generate an information score to show the value of the data. Also btw this is completely automated with no interaction needed.<p>I have the following ones in mind 
1.  Preliminary analysis of your data
2. Auto clean &amp; summaries of your data. 
3. Give Pre analyzed and cleaned data
4. All is meant to do in real time<p>Incase you know any competitors&#x2F; you find no value please do let me know.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
