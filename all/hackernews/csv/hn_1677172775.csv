  - Quickly share prompt snippets together with parameters and generated output. Think of it as CodePen or JSFiddle for prompts
  - Create high level endpoints on top of provider APIs (Open AI, DreamStudio etc) with templated and versioned prompts
  - Use built-in caching for endpoints that will help save on Open AI costs and improve latency
</code></pre>
We built Promptly at MakerDojo (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makerdojo.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makerdojo.io</a>) to simplify our prompt experimentation and deployment to production for text to SQL and plot generations. Currently, Promptly supports Open AI&#x27;s completions, image generation, and Stable Diffusion&#x27;s Text2Image with more on the way.<p>Please check it out at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trypromptly.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trypromptly.com</a> and let us know if you have any feedback.",story,https://trypromptly.com:443/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Over the last year I&#x27;ve been reading about software supply chain attacks and their consequences. Suffice to say, I&#x27;m paranoid! I&#x27;ve dabbled in a few tools such as Panoptisch(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33926782"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33926782</a>) but wanted to take this even further.<p>I came across Deno&#x27;s permission model which restricted access to APIs like network, file system, shell and ffi and wanted to take this idea to another language. Possibly as my final project at university.<p>Since I love Python, it made sense to try messing around with CPython. 
I&#x27;m quite satisfied (at the moment) with the result and thought about sharing it with the community for some feedback.<p>Looking forward to your thoughts and for the inevitable pwn of the implementation :)",story,https://github.com/R9295/cpython,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
