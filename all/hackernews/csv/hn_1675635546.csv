There&#x27;s going to be a persistent world with a small dump of lore each month, and larger world events twice a year. Campaigns are between groups of players in a shared world. We&#x27;re planning an actual play series and a bunch of other interesting things at the moment as well.<p>Happy to give any HN readers a free account to play around with.<p>There&#x27;s no VTT element and there&#x27;s no plan to build one; instead it&#x27;s focused on group storytelling and logging the story, rather than combat and world management.<p>The world and rule set is very much built to be around levelling the playing field so the GM isn&#x27;t expected to buy everything and be the centre of the world. Instead, players have as much agency as the GM does, and the world lore is free to access.<p>Registration link - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;triumvene.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;portal&#x2F;register<p>Sign up for the free preview and I&#x27;ll upgrade you to a full account.<p>Contact info - pete at watson-wail dot es.
