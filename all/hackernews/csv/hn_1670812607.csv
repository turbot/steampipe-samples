It increases productivity since users aren&#x27;t wasting time going back and forth between apps and can for example talk about external email threads and decide on what to reply right in (below) the email thread itself. It makes it easier for employees to communicate with employees from other businesses, with a web interface that allows inviting anyone to emails, group chats and meetings. It also allows modding, with businesses being able to build their own Slack-like apps and Discord-like bots not only for chat but also for email and meetings, and adapt it to their own needs. The main selling point, or slogan, would be something like: all-in-one team communication app for half the price.<p>With an app like that, how would one get their first few users?<p>With it being a crowded, well-established market, would pre-established businesses be willing to ditch what they already use for (what seems like) a small benefit? or if not how would you target newly-formed businesses which haven&#x27;t made a choice yet? could you target within-business teams rather than whole businesses?<p>Would you choose advertising, content marketing, talking to people (where would you find people to talk to?), or something else?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Most of the codebases I&#x27;ve worked with over the years have been very ad-hoc or not very close to the bleeding edge. Or, the highly performant codebases really weren&#x27;t amenable to hacking -- just for performing the main function they were built for (a single paper, benchmark, service, etc).<p>I&#x27;ve spent 120-130 hours or so rebuilding David Page&#x27;s lovely record-setting dawnbench project (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myrtle.ai&#x2F;learn&#x2F;how-to-train-your-resnet&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myrtle.ai&#x2F;learn&#x2F;how-to-train-your-resnet&#x2F;</a>) in a way that is generic and amenable to both hacking and rapid experimentation&#x2F;prototyping. One benefit of this is that the original code is extremely performance optimized, so not only is it an easy workbench to prototype on, but a good testbed for if a new method is orthogonal or not to older methods.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to make it as absolutely plug and play as possible -- to get started (if you&#x27;ve done your code scan due diligence and you&#x27;re setup on CUDA), you can just run `git clone <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tysam-code&#x2F;hlb-CIFAR10"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tysam-code&#x2F;hlb-CIFAR10</a> &amp;&amp; cd hlb-CIFAR10 &amp;&amp; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt &amp;&amp; python main.py` and you should see things training straightaway.<p>I hope this offers a nice combination of being fun and useful. I&#x27;ve already gotten a significant amount of value in testing some methods that would otherwise be very hard to test with it. In both cases, either change required just a single line to be added, which I felt validated the original design decisions. I have some hopefully-not-to-nefarious plans for it if I can get it down to the ~2 seconds mark within a few years.<p>I have a Patreon for those interested in seeing more similar work from me in the future. You can get that and other info from the github link above.<p>I plan on hanging around in the comments for a while in case anyone has any questions. Please do let me know, I love the conversation, and whether or not you like&#x2F;liked it, or if you find this intriguing or not -- this helps me build better software in the future! So please, feel free to drop a line. I&#x27;d love to hear what you think! :) :D",story,https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
