I’m a young freelancer. I can do it. It’s just _hard_ when I can lay in bed and no one will be disappointed in me, since my first meeting is probably 1pm. This leads to wasted billable hours hitting the snooze button, and general quality-of-life hits.<p>What I’d really like is a small group of tech people who expect eachother to show up at a meeting-like thing, fairly early in the morning, at the same time every day. Not really to talk about work, just… whatever.<p>Call it networking, but early in the morning. And hard-capped at 5-10min, max.
