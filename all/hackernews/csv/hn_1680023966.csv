I am the founder of Retorch. Retorch allow you to connect your data from any source including CSVs, SQL, Excel, Google Sheets etc... (and are looking at Stripe&#x2F;Market Data… integrations) and run queries on the data in natural language. We first retrieve the relevant data and convert your query into Python. We inject all of this into a Virtual Machine, and gather the output and show it to you. We have extended visualisation tools from dataframes, print logs and matplotlib into interactive visualisation tools that allow you to do more and (hopefully!) look and feel better and easier.<p>Above everything I’m genuinely just looking for feedback on my project - I am an parttime indie hacker (student) and I’ve built this over the last few weeks. Currently, I’ve tried tools that allow SQL queries but anything beyond that is impossible which seriously limits how much I could do with data, other than export it to colab and run analysis in python. Ive extended all of this so data retrieval and analysis are tied into one natural language interface.<p>I’ve add certain features beside prompt engineering that I hope make the product more useful like a debug loop (i.e. feed errors back to the LLM to generate new code), persistent VM connections with high RAM (let’s say I create a linear regression model in one prompt, I can call it in the next prompt, and a micro Python IDE so you can change the generated code itself and run a new version of it.<p>Any and all feedback + criticism welcome.",story,https://retorch.co/about,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35344177,Ask HN: How do you know that it's time to shutdown your startup?,2023-03-28T16:57:56Z,switchstance,1,false,false,,,,,,"I started Bestlist.com around two years ago. It is a search and discovery app that allows users to find the best of anything. The idea came about after I had grown tired of the current state of search, where a query often resulted in SEO-optimized blog posts instead of the desired information.
In a nutshell, Bestlist works by taking the user’s query, scraping the internet for reputable articles and social media posts relating to the query and extracting the mentioned “listings.” To form our ranking, we take many factors into account. We look at occurrences, the listing’s ratings on various sites, sentiment regarding the listing, and a few other things. Our results are not perfect, but we’re improving them on a daily basis.<p>We launched on Producthunt with lackluster results. After talking with users and getting feedback, the main issue I see is that people all have their own ways of searching and finding what they’re looking for, and Bestlist doesn’t provide enough of an “Aha” moment to stay at the top of mind to form new habits.<p>I’ve been funding the five person company with revenue from the sell of my first company, but I’m having a hard time stomaching spending more money each month, when we seem to be make little to no progress in winning users over. Add to that, the seemingly overnight onslaught in AI capabilities and the fear that what we’re creating is heading towards obsolescence, and I feel absolutely defeated.<p>A competitor of our’s raised a $10 million series A recently, so there are clearly some believers in the problem we’re trying to solve.<p>I&#x27;m at a loss. When do you know it’s time to shut your startup down? Any feedback is welcomed.<p>Thank you, Tyler",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
