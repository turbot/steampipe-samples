As a team, I&#x27;m the better one at inventing a niche business model and writing software in the context of the whole technical architecture, but my relative shortcomings are glaring. In fact it seems like everything I don&#x27;t know much about GPT-4 knows practically all there is to know! So far it has successfully helped me draft a specific business model in terms of discrete MVP features, narrowing down the whole problem space into the small set of things that can be demoed in about 1 month. I am confident that GPT-4 will be just as capable as we bring our startup into month 2.<p>If using an LLM as a co-founder is not completely feasible today surely it will be soon. We&#x27;re clearly much closer to it being possible than impossible. What will this mean for the startup economy? You can imagine a world with more solo founders, less co-founder disputes, a world where founders need to only have expert-level specialty in 1 area because LLMs will fill in the rest of the knowledge gaps.<p>On the whole it looks like the cost of turning brilliant ideas into tangible products is quickly falling.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
