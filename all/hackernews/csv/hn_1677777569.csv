When I set up my account, I entered a bad phone number and now I can&#x27;t recover my account because AWS requires both an email and phone number for account recovery.<p>I&#x27;ve already reached out to AWS support, and they&#x27;ve firstly asked me to provide a completed, signed, and certified Identity Verification Form and Affidavit. I provided it. Then they asked me other documentation to confirm the identity of the person who notarized or witnessed the form. I asked to mayor&#x27;s agent to put something as proof, she put a city stamp but AWS support refuses it.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has experienced a similar issue with recovering their AWS account and if they have any advice or tips on how to successfully recover it.<p>PS: I had fortunately created an AWS IAM root account so I am able to do many things but can&#x27;t access to expenses&#x2F;budgets details. The only way for me to get  it is the monthly AWS expenses mail. That&#x27;s more and more fsutraing.<p>Any help will be appreciated.
