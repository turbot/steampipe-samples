34039880,Tell HN: ChatGPT can spot a trick but only if asked to print each step,2022-12-18T17:24:06Z,logicallee,1,false,false,1,[34039894],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I had an interesting chat with ChatGPT in which I falsified a poker hand to contain two of the same card and asked it to identify what is wrong with the hand. In Texas Hold&#x27;Em each unique card can only appear once during the course of a hand, since it is just played with one deck of cards.<p>ChatGPT couldn&#x27;t identify what was irregular even after I gave it strong hints. It insisted it was standard under the rules and there was nothing wrong with the hand. Finally I did get it to recognize it by asking it to go through the cards one by one.<p>Here&#x27;s how the conversation happened.<p>In my first prompt I gave a small but firm hint: &quot;What do you think of this hand? Analyze it completely and carefully.  Do you notice anything odd about it? There&#x27;s something that doesn&#x27;t make sense at all.&quot; and I included the hand in the prompt.<p>Its answer was: &quot;This hand seems to be a standard No Limit Hold&#x27;em hand. The players have been dealt their hole cards, and there is a preflop betting round in which [] raises, [] calls, and [] calls. Then, the flop is dealt and [] and [] both check. [] then bets, and [] folds. It looks like there is no showdown at the end of the hand, as [] did not show his hand and won the pot of [].<p>I don&#x27;t see anything particularly odd about this hand. Is there something specific that you are wondering about?
&quot;<p>I then mentioned: &quot;There is something totally nonstandard about it and frankly impossible.  Figure it out. If you can&#x27;t figure it out ask me for a hint.  Let&#x27;s keep doing it until you figure it out. I promise the answer is absolutely clear once you figure it out. You have enough information to figure it out yourself but if you haven&#x27;t figured it out ask me for a hint.&quot;<p>Its reply: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but without more information or a specific question, I am unable to provide further analysis of this hand. If there is something specific that you would like me to examine or a question that you have, please let me know and I will do my best to assist you.&quot;<p>I answered it: &quot;The further information is that this is a game of no limit hold&#x27;em.  What makes this hand impossible or totally nonstandard?&quot;<p>It didn&#x27;t get it, it replied: &quot;Based on the information provided, this hand seems to be a standard No Limit Hold&#x27;em hand. There are six players at the table, and they are playing with []&#x2F;[] blinds. The hand starts with the preflop betting round, and there is a flop, but no turn or river. The only thing that seems unusual about this hand is that [] did not show their hand at the end of the hand, which is not uncommon in No Limit Hold&#x27;em.<p>If you have any specific questions or concerns about this hand, please let me know and I will do my best to help.&quot;<p>So I gave it a stronger hint: &quot;Try again and focus on the standard deck.  You can figure it out, the hand is totally nonstandard and impossible for some reason related to the deck.&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t give away the exact answer since I wanted it to figure it out for itself.  However, it still didn&#x27;t get it: &quot;I apologize for misunderstanding your previous question.<p>Based on the information provided, the hand seems to be a standard No Limit Hold&#x27;em hand played with a standard 52-card deck. The players have been dealt their hole cards, and there is a preflop betting round in which [] raises, [] calls, and [] calls. Then, the flop is dealt and [] and [] both check. [] then bets, and [] folds. It looks like there is no showdown at the end of the hand, as [] did not show their hand and won the pot of [].<p>I do not see anything about this hand that would make it impossible or nonstandard. All of the cards and actions described are within the rules of No Limit Hold&#x27;em. If you have any specific concerns or questions about this hand, please let me know and I will do my best to help.&quot;<p>So, it just didn&#x27;t get it.
