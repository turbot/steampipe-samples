I&#x27;m curious about whether the trend is due to personal interests (e.g., wanting to create production-quality software instead of research prototypes, wanting to avoid &quot;publish-or-perish&quot; pressures, higher salaries offered for SE positions) or due to other reasons (I have noticed a gradual winding down of industrial research labs in the past decade).
