34664244,"Show HN: Distributed Inference,Apply DL to WebRTC Video Frames via Redis Streams",2023-02-05T12:09:25Z,adalkiran,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN!<p>I’m so excited to show my another open-source project here. It is a PoC project.<p>Distributed Inference is a project to demonstrate an approach to designing cross-language and distributed pipeline in deep learning&#x2F;machine learning domain, using WebRTC and Redis Streams.<p>This project consists of multiple services, which are written in Go, Python, and TypeScript, running on Docker. It allows setting up multiple inference services in multiple host machines, in a distributed manner. It does RPC-like calls and service discovery via my other open-source projects, go-inventa and py-inventa, you can find them in my profile too.<p>Also includes a monitoring stack configuration using Grafana, InfluxDB, Telegraf, and Prometheus.<p>The main idea is:<p>- Webcam video will be streamed to the Media Bridge service via WebRTC,
- Media Bridge service will capture frame images from the video as JPEG images, pushes them to Redis Streams,
- One of available Inference services will pop a JPEG image data from Redis Streams stream, execute YOLOX inference model, push detected objects&#x27; name, box coordinates, prediction score, and resolution to other Redis Streams stream,
- The Signaling service listens and consumes the Redis Streams stream (predictions), sends the results to relevant participant (by participantId in the JSON) via WebSockets.
- Web client will draw boxes for each prediction, and writes results to the browser console.<p>Please check it out and I’d love to read your thoughts!<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adalkiran&#x2F;distributed-inference"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adalkiran&#x2F;distributed-inference</a>",story,https://github.com/adalkiran/distributed-inference,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

In that lecture the presenter showed a video of a speech (starts at 6mins 10secs in to the lecture). There are subtitles to that speech; I have never seen such interesting subtitling. Even the coughing and laughing etc from the audience is subtitled :)<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DVwpzJw1vwo,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
