35285664,Show HN: LiveQuery GPT-4 – Chatbot with Real-Time Search,2023-03-24T06:22:44Z,fredliu,2,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;d like to share ChatGPT-Live, a project I built to extend the capabilities of GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 turbo) by allowing it to access live data from the Internet. Leveraging the power of LangChain&#x27;s Conversational ReAct technology and the simplicity of the Gradio interface, the implementation is dead simple.<p>While the recent announcement of the ChatGPT plugin definitely reduced the need for this specific use case, I hope ChatGPT-Live serves as an example to show case the versatility of LangChain and demonstrates how easy it is to build generative AI applications. I hope you guys still finds it valuable in a certain way and I&#x27;m eager to hear your thoughts and feedback!",story,https://github.com/fredliubojin/langchain_gradio,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
