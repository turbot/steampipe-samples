34675079,Tired of Software,2023-02-06T09:06:36Z,itvision,2,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;ve been around software and computers for three decades already and I&#x27;m getting very tired of it.<p>Why do we have a constant stream of updates, security fixes, improvements, etc. etc. etc.? Why can&#x27;t we enjoy something ... stable and complete?<p>I&#x27;m thinking back in 80s&#x2F;90s software was released as something which required basically no maintenance, it didn&#x27;t crash, it just worked. Nowadays, everything is fixed, improved, streamlined and optimized all the time. What&#x27;s worse, software is often released as early beta, you may even say late alpha and of course I&#x27;m talking about games.<p>Why has it happened? Why does this affect seemingly only the software industry? We have equally if not more complicated things such as planes, rockets, cars, microwave ovens, refrigerators, buildings, etc. etc. etc. which are produced&#x2F;built as something complete. Of course there are recalls here and there but they are the exception, not the rule.<p>What do you think? Are you content with the status quo? What would you change? What would you mandate if you were in a position to enact laws?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
