Since I&#x27;ve had the Kudotap domain for a while, I decided to build a fun predictions website where you could bet virtual (not real) money on predictions made by others, and also make predictions of your own.<p>Building it turned out to be considerably easier and more fun than I anticipated. And the site in question (kudotap) turned out to be more engrossing than a lot of sites I&#x27;ve built (crazy!)<p>Primary tools used were:
<i>QuickEdit as the mobile code editor (Note: the free version of the QuickEdit app is riddled with ads, it shows an advert each time you close a tab, but it unfortunately had the best UI of the 3 or so Android code editors I tested. Ended up using NetGuard to block it from retrieving &amp; displaying ads),<p></i>PHP for the Backend ( custom PHP microframework I&#x27;ve used and built on over the past 7ish or so years ).<p><i>jQuery for the frontend js (</i>cringing<i>) - it appears I&#x27;m either too dumb, too old, or simply too lazy to learn React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;et al. Every once in a while, I pick one of them to learn, but I always end up returning to jQuery - or time-permitting - amateur level vanilla JS.<p></i>Bootstrap for the CSS - Battle-tested. For a purely backend dev with minimal design skills, good ol&#x27; Bootstrap (and in a growing number of cases, young gun Tailwind) is always a life saver.<p><i>Whole thing is hosted on 2 VMs (1 hosting the web app, and 1 hosting Redis &amp; MySQL).<p></i>As to the site itself, it turned out to be pretty cool to play around with. Go there, view the predictions, bet on the predictions you believe will come true, or against the ones you think will not. You get $50,000 to bet with (not real money). No signup is required to bet, but a quick signup is required to make a prediction. Hope you guys like it, and please be ruthless in telling me of any bugs you&#x27;ve found.<p>So go on here =&gt; kudotap.com<p>And Have Fun!",story,https://kudotap.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
