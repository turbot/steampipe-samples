Currently a GPM at a ~5k employee company. I’ve been learning and writing code for years now, but never ‘seriously’ - just side projects and a few MVPs. Looking at some ‘most popular full stack interview questions’ - I easily know 99% of the answers and I feel confident I’ll be able to make an impact. Above all - I really enjoy it.
I’m considering changing lanes for a bit and trying my luck as a full stack dev. I want to shift the balance from being focused on talking to people to actually making stuff with my bare hands.<p>A few things I’m curious about:<p>- Did anyone walk this path and survived to share their experience? Will I regret this? - In today’s market, any tips on how to even get to a screening call with my apparently irrelevant CV?<p>Any other thoughts welcome.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
