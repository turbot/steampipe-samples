Feel free to drop a ! Or just join the Discord: (see repo Discord badge on GitHub for link), your choice.<p>I&#x27;ve built an open-source tool which allows anyone to get started algotrading on a paper or live account for free. The tool includes everything you need to get started with aggregating and analyzing data through the Yahoo Finance and Alpaca APIs, and on top of that is completely free! It supports new strategies in an easily extensible way, meaning that you can get your own strategies up, running, and tested in just minutes.<p>My goal was initially to test out some high frequency trading strategies that I came up with, but along the way I realized that I could add methods on to support any custom strategy. Now that I feel confident with the documentation I&#x27;ve written, the code, and the GUI, I want to share it with all of you.<p>Some cool features that I haven&#x27;t mentioned already are:
- realtime: monitors stocks by the minute to buy, sell, and hold based on a strategy.
- oh, and the stocks it monitors are completely configurable: currently, the defaults are about 500 of the largest companies by market cap.
- comes out of the box with an ARIMA strategy: basically determines the probability of increase or decrease to influence actions.
- growing community on Discord.
- free, open-source, and non-tracking. Other tools are expensive, log your data and&#x2F;or strategies, or just are a black-box for extensibility.<p>I plan to keep updating this as the project gains traction. I am open to any suggestions and feature requests through GitHub issues.",story,https://github.com/Finned-Digital-Solutions/hft-ext,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
