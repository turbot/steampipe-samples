It is said that is can produce code that can outperform C++.<p>That sounds great in theory but in reality JIT languages are slower than statically compiled languages. CPU cycles have to be dedicated at run time to analyse and optimise code.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to articulate but in essence my dilemma is the JVM is a marvel of engineering with many many hours spent developing it. However the end result (from a performance metric) is that JIT programs are not faster than statically compiled programs.<p>So what is the purpose of the JIT compilation model for statically typed languages over AOT compilers?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
