All of the features highlighted here are &quot;FREE&quot; (we just take a cut from your scheduled recruiter calls)<p>PoachMe.dev is your one stop shop to being paid for the time you spend with recruiters on finding a job. From the hiring manager, to the recruiter, to the HR team cutting you an offer letter, every single person in the chain is getting paid while a candidate gets to pretend their money and time and resources aren&#x27;t dwindled every time they take an interview so this turns it back on it&#x27;s head.<p>Have you ever received a random message asking for a random technology you don&#x27;t have while also claiming &quot;you&#x27;re a perfect fit&quot;? Send them a pre-composed &quot;reply template message&quot; from PoachMe (&quot;Great. Please book a slot on my calendar and we can chat more about this. You&#x27;ll receive my resume upon confirmation of the booking. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bk.poachme.dev&#x2F;Lazaro"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bk.poachme.dev&#x2F;Lazaro</a>&quot;) so they can schedule and pay for your time. You will be surprised how many great recruiters will blatantly tell you that you are not worth your time as soon as they&#x27;re asked to pony up even $100&#x2F;hr while making an easy 10k for placing you at a company. If your skills have value, you can cut through the recruiter chaff and get to the recruiters who are actually easy to work with in one easy step.<p>After we built this core feature, we&#x27;ve branched out to creating a career snapshot (www.poachme.dev&#x2F;#&#x2F;cs&#x2F;80jKqZYdBdeBd2J3uTdKIoqVgpk2) which allows you to showcase your skills in one single screen without it being a resume and have started work on a virtual business card you can update and flash unto NFC cards so you have a digital business card you can carry around with you (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bk.poachme.dev&#x2F;kBMf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bk.poachme.dev&#x2F;kBMf</a>)<p>Sign up today using the following limited signup code (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bk.poachme.dev&#x2F;3MXp"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bk.poachme.dev&#x2F;3MXp</a>).

35337106,Ask HN: Recommendations for AI assistants in React apps?,2023-03-28T07:32:56Z,bluecoconut,1,false,false,,,,,,"I just spent the last few days hacking and adding AI assistant behavior into a prototype app i&#x27;m making... (a hybrid chat + command prompt to my react (next) app) and I realized that the &quot;boundary&quot; is pretty toolkit oriented (feels like it could be packaged as a tool like any other component-y tool or like a package). Before I commit to maintaining this piece of code myself, I realized I should try and ask if anyone is making anything like this already or if there are already toolkits out there I should be using. My quick searching didn&#x27;t actually find anything, but the terms in this space are so new I might not be searching well.<p>Specifically my needs:<p>* I want to offer AI chatbot in my react app (It should be able to answer questions about &quot;what it sees&quot; in the app &#x2F; in it&#x27;s context view)<p>* I want the chatbot to be able to take actions in the app on the users behalf<p>* I want there to be a &quot;command prompt&quot; style interface (eg. command+shift+p in vscode, or command+shift+k in github, windows-key in windows, command+space on mac, etc...) that I put in a request, and it takes action.<p>* bonus: It would be nice if I could add an annotation on specific text boxes to turn them into auto-completing copilot style text-boxes<p>API wise:<p>* I want to define a stateful object (like a jotai atom) that I put in the current &quot;view&#x2F;app context&quot; (`.put({...}`) (some &lt;1000 character description of what is on the page currently, what misc&#x2F;specific component state is etc.) It&#x27;d be great if I could just shove too much into it, and it does some LRU-cache + random sampling to keep it small or something...<p>* I want to define a set of &quot;described&quot; callbacks&#x2F;actions (functions) that the AI can chose to run (essentially `callbacks={&#x27;click submit on form&#x27;: () =&gt; onClick(), &#x27;add a square at x,y to visual&#x27;: (x, y) =&gt; setObjects([...objects, Square(x, y)])}`)<p>(Essentially, treating the AI as an RL agent, where it has &quot;State&quot; and &quot;Actions&quot;... and it uses language to make a choice for action based on input from user, or in the chat-bot, can describe the current state to the user)<p>UI Component wise:<p>* I want a simple chat box (like those added by all of the other chat-box integrations)<p>* I want a command prompt that i can ask for it to do something, and it &quot;does the action&quot; out of the possible callbacks that are currently registered<p>I am &quot;feeling&quot; a vibe like this is a toolkit&#x2F;component that I should adopt from a standard rather than inventing&#x2F;maintaining my own, but I&#x27;m not aware of any &quot;add an AI assistant to a react app&quot; yet (So far all I&#x27;ve found is a voice assistant by AlanAI) -- can anyone point me towards any that exist or answer if you&#x27;re actively making something like this?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
