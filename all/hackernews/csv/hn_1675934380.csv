34721407,AI is not on-chain yet. Why so?,2023-02-09T09:03:56Z,gloosx,1,false,false,,,,,,"What I absolutely love about the Universe is the perpetual emergence of smart things from simple things. And this is fantastic news that people today are able to make transistors emerge into neural networks which are smart enough to impress. I&#x27;m a strong believer that the sentiency will follow, it is just a matter of increasing volume.<p>However, nature is balance – and complex social phenomena like corporations cannot subscribe to the requirements of nature, they are not balance. So I do intuit they will fail to create something as divine as sentience<p>If we really want to go this way, play nature, and create smart things – we need to do it in a peer-to-peer fashion. We invented cypher block-chains exactly for this. OpenAI, Microsoft, Google are just kids playing in the sandbox under staring parental supervision – why didn&#x27;t people fork GTP onto blockchain yet? Maybe I am missing such a project. Do you think on-chain, decentralised general intelligence AI projects will appear soon? Is it a good thing or it shouldn&#x27;t leave caring corporate hands? How one would approach questioning such a system morally?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
