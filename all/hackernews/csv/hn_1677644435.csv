34978544,Syncs your fav links across multiple browsers and accounts,2023-03-01T03:48:17Z,rafaelgandi,1,false,false,,,,,,"Stash was built to solve a simple problem - the agony of logging in to different computers and&#x2F;or  browsers using different accounts (Google, Microsoft, iCloud, etc.) and sometimes with different operating systems (macOS, Windows, Ubuntu, etc.). Stash comes to the rescue, so you can have your favorite links with you wherever you go, without needing to lock you in a single account. It&#x27;s like having a secret hiding spot for your favorite websites - you know, like that one time you hid your Halloween candy in the sock drawer.

Because who has time for that? Stash: the solution to your link-hoarding problems.<p>More Info:
