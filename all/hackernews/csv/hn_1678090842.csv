35038508,Ask HN: How do you get job interviewers to be more open-minded about you?,2023-03-06T07:53:21Z,Rewl,3,false,false,1,[35038558],,,,"Background: I graduated in the wake of the 2007–08 financial crisis with a non-CS degree and found a local contract web developer job on Craigslist. It was at a web agency doing some fairly straightforward PHP and CMS web development. Given the circumstances, I consider myself lucky that I got a job after college after only three months. Then I did some bouncing around multiple more contract jobs, mostly back-end development, and lasting anywhere from 3 months up to 18 months. As is the feast-or-famine nature of contract work, I constantly alternate between working and unemployed job-seeker.<p>Currently I&#x27;m aiming for my first full-time job in over a decade and have a few concerns on how to best present myself as a strong self-learner with an interest in learning more at work. And also deal with adapting to a full-time schedule.<p>From 500 or so applications last year, 20-some interviews (all ending at different stages, there is no single &quot;how far did I get&quot; - sometimes it&#x27;s 1 screening round, sometimes it&#x27;s 1 screen + 3 tech rounds) and not a single offer yet. I generally want to get more feedback such as the following:<p>&quot;You didn&#x27;t get a couple problems right, but you have potential and we are going to give you a chance&quot;<p>&quot;We are going to give you a contract to hire to prove yourself&quot;<p>&quot;You have shown yourself to be a self-starter, so you can just learn on the job&quot;<p>I am applying to junior roles as well, so the thought is that it&#x27;s expected that I shouldn&#x27;t be a master at anything. Why junior, though? Wasn&#x27;t my first job more than 10 years ago? Well, remember that I have just been hopping back and forth between contract work and no work, almost since the beginning. It is not a typical career.<p>Am I limiting myself too much with only junior and mid-level FT jobs?<p>If I interview at SWE jobs and nearly every professional tells me, &quot;you don&#x27;t have what we consider SWE at my job&quot; should I drop the &quot;software engineer&quot; and just call myself &quot;web developer&quot;?<p>I have worked a few jobs where I had the title of &quot;software engineer&quot; and others where I was called &quot;web developer&quot;. But from what most SWE jobs actually expect you to do nowadays, I consider myself lacking many skills that would place me beyond just a &quot;coder&quot; to an &quot;engineer&quot;. I know, I know, don&#x27;t sell your skills short. But that won&#x27;t stop other programmers from imposing their own standards onto you.<p>I apply to bog-standard mid-tier companies 95% of the time. Maybe even mid-tier is still too high a bar because of all the rejections. Strangely, though, my resume sometimes attracts FAANG recruiters, even though, again, I only make it through 1 or 2 interview rounds.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
