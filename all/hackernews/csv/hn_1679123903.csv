This is especially true with friends abroad with which I only interact a few times a year and that I sometimes forget to send updates to for a long time.<p>I&#x27;ve seen tools such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;monicahq&#x2F;monica that allow you to keep track of things but as far as I understand you have to enter things manually (i.e. when you last contacted them, what it was about, etc). I&#x27;m looking for a platform that allows you to create contacts, associate accounts from several platforms to them, and then search and backup your interactions with them on these platforms.<p>Does anyone know of such a tool?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
