35039916,How to solve a pricing conundrum with my app?,2023-03-06T11:48:14Z,octobereleven,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hey friends, I have a pricing question that I am trying to solve:<p>Working on something solo has its drawbacks — especially when trying to decide on something so crucial to the business.<p>Hence, I need any help I can get with the following...<p>Currently, blogstatic.io is $19&#x2F;year with all features included. However, at this rate (vists + reach), I don&#x27;t think the business can become self-sustainable before my runway ends.<p>The idea is to introduce new pricing plans but keep the $19&#x2F;year, which is something the blogstatic brand has become a synonym with = Carrd for blogging.<p>The $19&#x2F;year plan will have basic features that will help anyone new to blogging get started.<p>Now for the other plans, there are two ideas:<p>* Have 3 plans:
$19&#x2F;year,
$5&#x2F;month (paid yearly $50), and
the business one $15&#x2F;month, which includes multi-author and more advanced newsletter features<p>OR<p>* Have 1 plan only!
Have only the $19&#x2F;year plan and make everything else an add-on that users can purchase as they need.<p>===<p>I personally like the add-on idea. It&#x27;s a straightforward one, and you can add to your &quot;cart&quot; widgets&#x2F;options you need and nothing you don&#x27;t.<p>Example: Say there&#x27;s a feature on the $5&#x2F;month plan, but you don&#x27;t need the rest — with the &quot;plans&quot; only approach, you will &quot;have to&quot; upgrade — with the &quot;add-on&quot; approach, you can purchase that one single thing in the &quot;Store,&quot; and you&#x27;re done.<p>However, I am afraid that the &quot;add-on&quot; approach is a tedious one for the user — they have to &quot;buy&quot; everything individually.<p>— Is this a good practice?
— Do people care?<p>My goal is to keep it easy and yet have a self-sustainable business. I am totally fine with leaving money on the table, as long as those two criteria are fulfilled: Easy + Sustainability.<p>So my specific question is:
&quot;Plans,&quot; OR
&quot;Everything is an add-on&quot;?<p>I am all ears to hear what you can suggest — as a USER and as a business person.<p>Cheers<p>PS: I am Val, and here&#x27;s my personal blog with more context around blogstatic, if you&#x27;re interested: valsopi.com",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
