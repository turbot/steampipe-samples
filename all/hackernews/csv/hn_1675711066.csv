In the vein of [1], I&#x27;ve been meaning to ask you lot what resources you are using to program and debug Windows. I&#x27;ve <i>used</i> Windows since Windows 95, and have been on every single version until and including Windows 10. I thought it would be a great idea to learn more about and dive deeper into the OS I use every day.<p>The link above mentions Petzold&#x27;s book[2], and from what I&#x27;ve seen on Reddit, consensus is that the 5th edition is still the best to pick up, even though it was published 25 years ago. However, it is clear that Windows frameworks and development tools have changed significantly in the intervening years. There&#x27;s a plethora of UI frameworks using at least 3 languages: Win32, WinForms, WPF, WinRT, WinUI 3, MAUI, and MFC, in C, C++, and C#. I don&#x27;t know which to choose, where to start, and why.<p>I&#x27;m also interested in diving deeper into the Windows architecture as a whole, as well as the driver model, the NT kernel, and Windows &#x27;syscalls&#x27;, in a manner similar to <i>The Linux Programming Interface</i>[3] or <i>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</i>[4].<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the matter of scripting and automating Windows; I know PowerShell is recommended.<p>I am hoping to write modern, fast, responsive, and native (i.e. HiDPI &amp; HDR-aware) programs for Windows; my current experience is mostly command-line cross-platform C++20 and a bit of .NET 6, as well as C using Linux APIs.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34680345<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.charlespetzold.com&#x2F;pw5&#x2F;<p>[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;tlpi&#x2F;<p>[4]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apuebook.com&#x2F;apue3e.html",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The legitimate company receives complaints when the victim tries to complain or get their money back ultimately damaging the brand&#x2F;business of the company.<p>We&#x27;re unsure of the scope of this scam but we believe it&#x27;s very large as we interviewed victims that lost from USD$15-50K. You can see a warning about this scam at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fenzodigital.com&#x2F;.<p>Many of the scam sites have a reverse IP of 20.232.140.198 and you can see a small sample of the +1000 domains we&#x27;re aware of at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;1tbqtfPi.<p>We believe the host resolves to a CDN based in China (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dnsqx.com&#x2F;gfcdn.html) that is hosted on Azure.<p>We&#x27;ve:<p>* Contacted the Registrar (Name.com) but they basically said we need to contact the host or work through ICANN.<p>* Submitted a complaint to the domain registrant through Name.com (no response yet)<p>* Submitted a complaint to Azure (no response yet)<p>* Tried contacting the CDN through Telegram (no response yet)<p>Are there any other suggestions for bringing down this scam ASAP?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I am programming since 2013, but for most of my career I worked in the foreign sales and programming was just a hobby. I burned out hard in my last job, and I&#x27;ve recently started to shyly think about a career change.<p>I am pretty sure I am not employable as a junior developer right now. Being hobbyist, besides lack of degree, causes several problems in my case, among others:<p>a) For a very long time I didn&#x27;t really care about code quality. Only two years ago started handling errors instead of optimizing for happy path. A year ago, I started writing tests. Just recently started learning about the design patterns, and still don&#x27;t understand most of them.<p>b) Proof of inflexibility, kind of. My portfolio is 90% roguelike games. Never did frontend or backend work. My personal website is generated by MKDocs and hosted on GitHub.<p>c) During that 10 years, I am sure I developed some bad habits that will be difficult to get rid of.<p>d) I simply don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know.<p>So I am wondering what knowledge and skills should I acquire to apply for junior positions? Also, should I already dedicate myself to a specific role and framework? Does it even make sense to try, or I&#x27;m too old already?<p>Would love to learn your insights.<p>Best regards,
