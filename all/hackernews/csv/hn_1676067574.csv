34746262,Tell HN: Discord is obviating my need to use StackOverflow,2023-02-10T21:38:19Z,satvikpendem,4,false,false,,,,,,"Everyone&#x27;s talking about ChatGPT eating SO&#x27;s lunch these days, but I&#x27;ve found Discord servers are vastly more responsive and more correct than any AI tool. I can usually ask a question on Discord and get a response within 30 seconds as many people start responding. Sometimes they ask clarifying questions and generally speaking that will be enough for them to answer. If I asked the same question on SO, I would have to wait days, months, or even years for an answer. This is what happened to some of the questions I&#x27;ve seen there, with many questions also not having any answers at all.<p>The problem, of course, is indexability for search engines; SO is very indexable, and Discord is opaque. People therefore keep asking the same questions over and over again on the Discord server.<p>For those curious as to what Discord servers I&#x27;m in (grouped into folders, comments in parentheses):<p>Web Dev:<p>- Rome Tools (makers of an all-in-one JS toolchain, written in Rust)<p>- Deno<p>- Next.js<p>- vanilla-extract (great compile-time CSS-in-JS library)<p>- Astro.js<p>- Reactiflux (best Discord server for general React related questions)<p>- TypeScript<p>- GraphQL<p>- GraphQL Dart (for Flutter projects)<p>- Foam (open source Roam alternative in VSCode)<p>- ZeroToMastery (took a few of their courses before)<p>Design:<p>- Three.js<p>- Poimandres (makers of react-three-fiber, jotai, zustand, etc)<p>- Framer (for framer-motion)<p>- Bruno Simon (maker of the ThreeJS Journey course)<p>- Kevin Powell (YouTuber with advanced CSS tutorials, usually replicating some design seen online)<p>- Rive (animation tool built in Flutter)<p>- Friends of Figma (official Figma Discord server)<p>Flutter:<p>- Riverpod ecosystem (similar to Poimandres, makers of many useful Flutter packages)<p>- &#x2F;r&#x2F;FlutterDev<p>- Rivaan Ranawat (YouTuber with advanced Flutter tutorials)<p>- Shorebird (new company by ex-tech-lead of Flutter, but lots of Flutter team members to talk to)<p>Rust:<p>- The Rust Programming Language (official server)<p>- Rust Programming Language<p>- Actix Web (backend API framework)<p>- Zero To Production In Rust (great book about how to make your own backend API in Rust, with Actix Web)<p>- Prisma Client Rust + rspc (using Prisma to generate type-safe Rust bindings to the database)<p>DevOps:<p>- coolLabs (makers of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coolify.io, the best open source Heroku replacement in my opinion)<p>- Docker<p>- Supabase<p>Miscellaneous Programming:<p>- ReasonML<p>- iOS Programming<p>- Teach Yourself CS (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teachyourselfcs.com, a structured way of learning computer science)<p>AI:<p>- TVP &amp; MVP community (video interpolation, especially animated)<p>- NMKD Software (video interpolation and Stable Diffusion client)<p>- Stable Foundation (official Stable Diffusion server)<p>- Unstable Diffusion<p>- SAIL<p>Miscellaneous:<p>- &#x2F;r&#x2F;Productivity<p>- &#x2F;r&#x2F;Startups<p>- Furlough (good community for talking about startups, high signal to noise)<p>- StockDrops (for finding GPUs &#x2F; consoles when they are available)<p>- Dream Cafe (lucid dreaming)<p>- Polyphasic Sleeping",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
