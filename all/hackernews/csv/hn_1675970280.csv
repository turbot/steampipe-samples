34729594,Ask HN: Do ads push you beyond monthly data caps?,2023-02-09T19:15:54Z,winternett,2,false,false,,,,,,"I frequently upload and view video content on my mobile phone because I work as a musician. It frustrates me beyond words that my mobile service provider (&quot;F-Mobile&quot;) has data caps on their plans where they de-prioritize my device on towers if I exceed around 25GB each month. They also don&#x27;t currently offer any plans that do not impose this limit, even though they sold me my plan as unlimited to begin with years ago, (well before the idea of data caps was a thing). The company has a wild tendency to revise our contractual agreements to their favor profit-wise, and I&#x27;ve been paying over $75 a month for unlimited service that has this limit on it.<p>A funny thought occurred to me, as ads become more and more prevalent, and as speeds increase on mobile devices, our monthly data caps are hitting the limit more faster than ever, and I wonder if all of the ad content really factors into that?<p>Technically, if ads are pushed constantly to devices, counting that as data we opted into is not fair... Any company or individual could simply push a vast majority of people over their data limits by using HD video on apps like Twitter, TikTok, YouTube and other sites and apps, and technically there is no reliable way to measure or account for where monthly data is spent.<p>What type of work do you do and are you exceeding your monthly mobile or home internet data &quot;cap&quot;?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Your hypotheses don’t neatly factor into prototyping when just starting, so don’t worry--just think about how to integrate them with KPIs and OKRs later to double-use your iterations as tests. The initial product research is time expensive but should at least yield a consistent Persona with a real problem for you to solve: how you do product research is the million dollar question, do things that don’t scale™.<p>1. On Figma: design UI and UX for solution to problem you sourced from product research<p>2. Translate Figma images to written feature specifications; you’ll use these to reference documentation (step 3) and spike (step 4)<p>3. Choose and learn the fundamentals of a framework that can implement step 2. Feature specifications (e.g. React-Node-Express stack)<p><pre><code>   3a. Be careful of knowledge bloat (when one thing requires learning another, and another, etc.)--deal with it by keeping your learning feature-oriented

   3b.  Spend comparatively less time acquiring concepts the more abstract they get (e.g. when trying to implement a real-time updating dashboard, spend most time learning the javascript framework, then less time learning about JS promises, then less time learning about asynchronicity and … LEAST time learning about networking layers if you get that far)

   3c. Stick to a schedule and budget out time, this step requires singular focus
</code></pre>
4. Spike all of the features with that framework based on your learning in step 3.<p>5. Attempt to implement the feature list with minimal improvements on the spikes:<p><pre><code>   5a. first, just clobber together a frankenstein of your spikes

   5b. then optimize or polish (e.g. ensure no stateful widgets at top of widget tree in flutter, etc)

   5c. Don’t over optimize: just get all the features working together in a minimally viable way (no fancy animations, nothing you can’t do with a minimally decorated library function at most)
</code></pre>
6. Recruit initial users (how you do that is another thing entirely; it sometimes takes money and definitely time) and get them to engage with your prototype<p><pre><code>   6a. Take notes of their interactions however makes sense for you

   6b. Find concrete points where you can improve the product--note these down

   6c. If you did product research well, you should have a group of people matching your persona to reach out to
</code></pre>
7. Set up metrics for the issues identified in 6.a,b, called KPIs, and goals, called OKRs--an OKR is a target value for a KPI; iterate until your KPIs match the OKRs<p><pre><code>  7a. Adjust KPIs and OKRs to make sense for each stage of hypothesis testing
</code></pre>
Note: getting initial users (step 6) functions as your marketing. Do things that don’t scale to get initial users. Marketing at later stages is a different beast.<p>Note 2: steps are susceptible to chicken-egg-problem. In that case be the egg, get warm, and wait--solving this is also a million$ question<p>________________________________________________<p>PLease let me know in comments if:
