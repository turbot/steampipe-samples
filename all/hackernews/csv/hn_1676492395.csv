34809805,Ask HN: What's more valuable: expert or broad knowledge in different areas?,2023-02-15T20:05:45Z,lichtenberger,1,false,false,,,,,,"What do you think is more valuable, being an expert for specific topics&#x2F;stuff as security&#x2F;database systems&#x2F;performance engineers or maybe who have expert knowledge in one or two programming languages and perhaps a lot of frameworks and things like that or engineers who know a lot of languages a little bit, to maybe chose the right language for the right &quot;smaller&quot; project?<p>It certainly all depends if you do consulting&#x2F;customer projects or have projects of your own with consulting on top, for instance. However, after ten years working extensively with Java and lately some Kotlin in the backend, I would like to know if I should have a much broader knowledge or the desire to learn everything (yeah, well, we all know a couple of languages a little bit). I&#x27;m currently learning TypeScript, and most languages, if they are not purely functional, are relatively easy to learn with some experience. But I&#x27;ll sure lack some depth and to learn the major frontend concepts for instance underlying the frameworks, build tools, you name it will certainly need much more time than 2 or 3 months.<p>I think the most interesting from my perspective, however, is a much deeper knowledge of specific topics (for instance, lately, I&#x27;m all about reading latency&#x2F;throughput-related stuff, as I&#x27;m extensively profiling my OSS database project and I&#x27;m reading books from experts as Brendan Gregg...).<p>What&#x27;s your opinion on the topic? For example, be an expert in something or be able to use the right tool for the right project at hand, but maybe not be able to use it in the best idiomatic way or not know all the pitfalls and stuff you&#x27;d probably know if you&#x27;re more specialized?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
