Not trying to change the world here, but hoping some people here can offer insights that might help me form my own opinion.<p>Under capitalism corporations are driven by profit motive and will do unethical things to achieve profits. Regulation can help, but in a capitalist society these same corporations can affect legislation - this is one example of a form&#x2F;source of corruption that I think is inherit in any one of these systems and which I think is the fundamental reason why none of them can be perfect.<p>In theory, communism solves this by having workers control the means of production - the PEOPLE are the ones making the decisions. The proletariat isn&#x27;t infallible but it&#x27;s at least better to have them in control since their motives aren&#x27;t at odds with the wellbeing of the population - they ARE the population. Afaik the downside of this is that it also leads to corruption, as some body(government) needs to oversee and enforce such a system, which necessarily means that a large amount of  power will be concentrated in this body. To be honest, I don&#x27;t fully understand this dynamic, but mostly trust it since the historical outcomes of communism seem to reflect this - if anyone can explain the inner mechanics of why&#x2F;how power needs to be concentrated in this way under communism I&#x27;d love to hear. Another downside is that such a system leads to lack of motivation among workers, this criticism I don&#x27;t trust as much and suspect it comes from people who think communism = no PERSONAL(not private) property and that everyone is paid the same amount, however I&#x27;m sure there are people with a real understanding who can explain this pitfall in a more sensible way and I&#x27;d love to hear it.<p>From what I can tell, &quot;socialist&quot; countries like Denmark and Sweden have at least done a better job than communism&#x2F;capitalism, based purely on the subjective satisfaction of it&#x27;s people and it&#x27;s(relative) lack of human rights&#x2F;climate&#x2F;political&#x2F;etc atrocities. However I&#x27;m not very familiar with the political systems in these countries - many tell me they&#x27;re not even actually socialist, and others tell me it&#x27;s actually nowhere as good as many people claim. This is kind of where I&#x27;m at now, wanting to learn more about these countries and their systems, but I&#x27;d love it if people could provide fair and constructive input about any potential systems, both in terms of the efficacy and their realistic potential to be implemented",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
