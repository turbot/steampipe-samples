(For ex: puncture it with a precision Laser etc)
Firing it with a missile made the debris to spread
over 10km radius. Now they are painfully collecting 
the debris. And now they say, &quot;we will study the debris!&quot;
Any reason why was it destructively shot down?<p>Further, USA action shows, nearly no military has a device
to safely bring down a man-made object floating in sky at 20km altitude. 
Agree, shooting a competitor&#x27;s object has a subtle message.
