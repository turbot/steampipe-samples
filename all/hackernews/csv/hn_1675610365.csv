I failed out of my universities CS program and ended up doing philosophy with a double minor in math and stats. It&#x27;s my fault. I got cocky. My university is extremely cut throat when it comes to the CS program so even if I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten in with really pushing myself, I would not be complaining right now. I failed intro to CS twice and passed on the 3rd try with a 52. Switched to philosophy after taking being put on suspension. Recovered my GPA (a bit) and finished university last year. Even though I shat the bed with university, I did a lot of hackathons, audited courses because of pure interest (through MIT open courseware), and getting internships. I ended up joining Shopify as a fullstack. But now, I really want to go back to school and learn things the traditional way because it feels too overwhelming. I can&#x27;t work in the states because of tn visa regulations. My gpa is pathetic because of the failed courses in early years. I really don&#x27;t have the patience to start a second degree at a third tier college&#x2F;university because it&#x27;s pointless to do so. I want to get into one of those online masters programs but let&#x27;s be honest, with a pathetic 2.44 cgpa there is no way any masters program is gonna let me in.
