35212091,Tell HN: Fake websites are gaming Google's system,2023-03-18T19:06:12Z,supriyo-biswas,2,false,false,,,,,,"We know Google search has been going downhill for some time. While LLMs may or may not ultimately be the cause of Google&#x27;s demise, I was quite surprised to see how easy it is for a fake website to be ranked well on Google.<p>Recently I Googled &quot;chatgpt&quot; and the second link[1] caught my attention. It points to a website named &quot;chat-gpt[.]org&quot; containing some generic SEO fluff and a button button to try the faux ChatGPT. Ironically, said filler also appears to be written by ChatGPT itself, given the excessive moralizing about &quot;as an AI language model...&quot;<p>Given that websites masquerading as the real ChatGPT only to deliver malware are common[2][3], I did not explore the website further. However, I was curious about how they managed to get ranked as the 2nd result on Google, and I looked at Ahrefs backlink database and they spammed a bunch of websites and forums[4][5] with links.<p>So there you have it. While Google claims they&#x27;ve moved on from PageRank and that they penalize spamming rings and inorganic backlinks, I&#x27;m seeing an easily game-able system so long as you can spam links on many websites and piggyback off of a popular term. In fact, there are tools that help you spam tons of websites (I&#x27;m not sure if I can mention them here so I&#x27;ll just leave them out) and maybe that strategy has always worked.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;JpOSrjU.png<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;therecord.media&#x2F;chatgpt-phishing-fake-websites-hackers-malware<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cyble.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;22&#x2F;the-growing-threat-of-chatgpt-based-phishing-attacks&#x2F;<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;TRZmSpj.png<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;aSVnop6.png",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
