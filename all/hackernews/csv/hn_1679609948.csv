https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sloev&#x2F;research-into-serverless-git-based-cms&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;README.md<p>which roughly is to create two repos:
one repo for a single file cms in the form of a cloudflare worker that does ultra simple access control together with image upload (presigned backblaze urls) and form submit (musicevents new&#x2F;updated) as json<p>another repo for keeping the layout plus all the music events json etc
this repo can be public andwill build static html on each push<p>my question is : &quot;is this gonna make the site more maintainable in the future?&quot;<p>currently they have no person responsible for the website s it has to be easy to get into and maintain for an occational dev",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
