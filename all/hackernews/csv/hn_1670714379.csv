33938052,Show HN: Trade on Elon's Tweets,2022-12-10T23:09:46Z,tomsaas,1,false,false,1,[33938115],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi,
I present my new tool which helps you with trading.<p>The Problem:
When Elon Musk and other big players tweet about stocks, crypto, etc. sometimes these tweets manage to make a huge effect on a stock or crypto market. Therefore not being among the first ones who sees these tweets can be really disappointing.<p>The Solution:
- Tracksy.co tool monitors Elon Musk&#x27;s tweets so that you could get notified whenever he tweets again. Also as Elon is not the only big player in Twitter, Tracksy.co has the ability to track other 5 Business and 5 Crypto world influencers + 3 ANY Twitter profiles of your choice.
- Tracksy.co can notify you about the tweets by sending you a SMS message or if you do not like getting a lot of SMSs, then you can choose Email as a notification method. Or both!
- Elon or other influencers can tweet a lot, meaning you would get a lot of SMSs or&#x2F;and Emails, therefore I strongly recommend you of using Tracksy&#x27;s tweet filters where you can specify any keyword(s) so that you would get notifications only when those keywords are mentioned in a Tweet (ex.: Bitcoin,Tesla).<p>Feedback:
Really appreciate your feedback.
- What do you think about this product?
- Is there anything that is missing in this product? If so I would consider adding it.
- Would you use Tracksy.co? If not, then why?
- Do you think the market fit is right (investors)? Maybe other social groups might also be interested in being the first ones to see someone&#x27;s tweets?<p>Thanks,
Tom",story,https://www.tracksy.co,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
