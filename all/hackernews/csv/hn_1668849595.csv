33668398,Ask HN: How to save/invest/deal with money?,2022-11-19T08:55:23Z,throw100g,3,false,false,1,[33668435],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I am a junior developer working at my first job as a software engineer. I&#x27;m studying in a part time model so I am studying 50% and working 50% of my time.
I get my salary every month but... What should I do with the money?
I am still living with my parents so I do not have to cover living costs, only pay them a little bit of rent. I never buy anything and I spend all my free time studying which I like. I have nearly 0 expenses. So I thought maybe it would be good to invest this &quot;extra income&quot; coming in every month. But where do I start?
I know nothing about finance or economy and whenever I try to look into it I don&#x27;t even understand how to get started because the entry fees seem high.
I am in Europe, maybe that&#x27;s relevant. I feel this money from my job is only a burden for me because all I do is have to pay the account fee to my bank... Highly appreciate any advice!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

They want to rewrite, &quot;clean&quot;, &quot;best practices&quot;, &quot;easier to maintain&quot;.<p>These are applications that work and serve millions of users a day, they are sometimes built upon unfamiliar libraries, they do things in ways you haven&#x27;t seen before, but does that make them bad? Does it justify rewriting them, into your own delineation of &quot;good code&quot;, so when you leave the next person starts the cycle again.<p>I&#x27;ve written code that is obselete within a few sprints due to the project going in a slightly different way. How is new code not subject to tech debt in the exact way older code is?<p>The more I see this behaviour, the less I want any part of rewrites. I am more than happy to be the person to iteratively improve on an existing, working system.<p>Maybe this has just become a rant, but I am curious of other&#x27;s experience.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
