34770855,David Duetsch: multiverse vs. virtual particles,2023-02-13T06:52:23Z,daly,1,false,false,,,,,,"I admit to being hardly qualified to hold forth on this subject but...<p>In his book &quot;The Fabric Of Reality&quot;, in discussing the odd results of the famous double slit experiment,
David postulates &quot;shadow photons&quot; which interact with the single photon to produce the interference result. He goes on to argue that there must be millions of these shadow photons. Since they don&#x27;t interact with any known measurement device they must exist elsewhere... From this he postulates that they exist in other universes and from that assumption concludes that the &quot;multiverse&quot; exists.<p>Given the same experiment, my conjecture differs. It is &quot;known&quot; that the vacuum gives rise to &quot;virtual particles&quot; ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtual_particle ). Indeed, these can be measured, giving rise to the Casimir effect ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casimir_effect ). Interactions between photons, especially in their wave-like characteristics, and virtual particles seems a more Occam&#x27;s Razor solution.<p>Does the interaction of the wave-like photon and the &quot;slot-space confinement&quot; occupied with virtual particles affect and explain the result? What effect would virtual particles have on the photon wave? Indeed, do virtual particle interactions with &quot;real&quot; particles explain the measurement collapse problem?<p>To that point, what effect does a &quot;slot&quot; have for virtual particle generation &#x2F; frequency &#x2F; wavelength &#x2F; etc.? Does virtual particle production change due to slot width? Do certain slot widths generate &quot;virtual standing waves&quot; that interact with particles? If the slots were &quot;Casimir-width&quot; does the double slit experiment outcome change? Perhaps &quot;shadow photons&quot; are just inducing &quot;resonant virtual particles&quot; to temporarily exist and affect the results.<p>The leap of faith from a double-slit result to a multiverse seems a bit too far for me to jump.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
