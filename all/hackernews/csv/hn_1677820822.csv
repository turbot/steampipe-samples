35006052,Tell HN: I physically can’t delete Tinder because of Fastmail/DDG email,2023-03-03T05:09:51Z,unsupp0rted,1,false,false,1,[35006089],,,,This seems like a Fastmail &#x2F; DuckDuckGo private e-mail problem.<p>Tinder support ticket emails go into a black hole.<p>Context:<p>I’m in a new city. I reset my Tinder account and bought 6 months of Platinum (their top tier).<p>I’m in Country A but I use a VPN for work that puts me in Country B. I forgot to keep my VPN off.<p>Tinder must have flagged my account within seconds. I have one match that reappears every time it’s swiped left or right. I press “Delete Account” to reset it and nothing happens. Either dev console shows a 500 on the request or the Tinder app says “There was a problem”.<p>My emails to support don’t get replies. But the next day I receive an email that says “How was Mia’s support?”.<p>Maybe their review system gets to my inbox but their ticketing system doesn’t?<p>I believe this is because I signed up to Tinder using a DuckDuckGo email that is tied to Fastmail. Tinder support ticket emails never hit my inbox or spam.<p>How can I possibly delete my Platinum Tinder account and reset if the system blocks deletion attempts and Support tickets never get to my inbox? It’s an unusable subscription.,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35006081,"Need advice/guidance on direction to go, affordable bootcamps",2023-03-03T05:15:01Z,TheOneDudeYa,1,false,false,,,,,,"Disclaimer: Have ADD and some higher than average social anxiety.<p>I&#x27;ve been working in IT for 3-4 years. I have a bachelor&#x27;s in computer science, but never accomplished much with it.<p>I work for a company that&#x27;s close in size to a FANG. I do emails, calls, and train people how to do my job. I can act as a main line of support for my entire team on how to navigate calls with difficult customers in Slack. My main issue is actually talking to them on the phone myself - that&#x27;s where I struggle.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to talk to my boss about only doing emails and training people - unfortunately, he&#x27;s not willing to compromise, which due to my anxiety has forced me to go on a medical leave. I&#x27;ve been attacked a ton on the phone, overly scrutinized, etc. despite being one of the best performers on my team. The part that really gets to me is helping complete strangers that can attack me with no possible witnesses or repercussions.<p>I don&#x27;t have a programming portfolio. Prior to this I had worked 3 months wiping laptops and supporting a bunch of sites on the east coast and setting up laptops.<p>I struggle to memorize large amounts of data to then spit out on command. That&#x27;s the ADD but also the nerves interfering with my ability to learn. I want to get some type of cisco certification but it&#x27;s a serious struggle.<p>I was thinking maybe I should do a low budget bootcamp. I currently have 9 weeks of FMLA available to me. I don&#x27;t have much money for bootamps.<p>Some advantages I have are that I&#x27;m armenian. I look and could technically classify myself as midde-eastern, and from what I know generally armenians stick together and will look to hire other armenians. Though I don&#x27;t want to &quot;take advantage of my different race&#x2F;ethnicity privilege &quot; I&#x27;m not at leisure to go with any option other than to use everything in my power to get out of my current situation. I&#x27;ve been working to gain a basic grasp of Syriac .<p>I want a job that requires minimal to no interaction with public customers UNLESS it is purely by email and web chat. I&#x27;m amazing at writing emails teaching people how to use their phones, laptops, and software + hardware. I&#x27;m probably one of the top 2 on my team at emails, and one of the top 3 at training people. I train agents in the US and Canada, as well as agents in Asia.<p>I can get really motivated at game development if there isn&#x27;t a huge learning curve to start seeing results from my projects. I used to develop games in this old engine called BYOND (www.byond.com) for years, did some freelance work that paid for my pizza and other things college kids do.<p>For my income I need to be making close to $30 an hour and remote work would probably best fit my personality. I live in Boston.<p>tl;dr
1. social anxiety+add. poor memory and social situations can be a bit nerve wracking
2. job is being mildly abusive, won&#x27;t let me work emails&#x2F;train people even though I&#x27;m one of the best on our team at this, forcing me to take phone calls when I&#x27;m having panic attacks
3. currently on family medical leave act for 3 months until I burn the time due to anxiety
4. 3 years in technical support and 3 months in IT resolving basic computer issues and setting up computers
5. Armenian, learning Siriac and begun attending armenian church. want to get closer to my culture but not going to lie it helps with job search 
6. very creative, used to freelance develop small games and work on small projects of my own.
7. Bachelors of science in comp sci but havent programmed in 4 years.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

With Noodle Nest method, your code can twist and turn in any direction, just like a bowl of noodles.
With Noodle Nest, you don&#x27;t waste time worrying about readability or maintainability. You just write, and let your code take on a life of its own.<p>Even better, learn assembly. Assembly++ noodle nest ++ kubernates == immortal
