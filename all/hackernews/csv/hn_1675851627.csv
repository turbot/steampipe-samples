34706098,Show HN: Kuboble.com – minimalistic sliding pieces puzzle game,2023-02-08T09:44:44Z,kuboble,8,false,false,,,,,,"Hi,<p>I wanted to share a simple game I wrote.<p>It&#x27;s a sliding pieces puzzle like many others. I have focused a lot on making the experience smooth and
 minimalistic and the levels being challenging in a way a sudoku or chess puzzles could be.<p>I had no prior knowledge of game development and while it feels like someone competent could build this game in a week I spent over two years and hundreds of hours to bring this game to life.<p>My journey went through:<p><pre><code>    - thinking it will be a PC game
    - being overwhelmed by the amount of different game frameworks
    - hiring an indie dev to bootstrap the game in Unity for me
    - realize the small levels are actually cool and it might fit on a phone
    - generating levels and playing through thousands of them myself to curate a smaller list
    - realizing the Unity wasn&#x27;t a good choice
    - rewriting the game in html + js drawing on canvas + React
    - hiring a bunch of fiverr artists and testers to polish it up
</code></pre>
I think I am finally satisfied with the result enough to be willing to share it with the world.<p>If you&#x27;re a fan of minimalist sliding pieces puzzles I&#x27;d be happy if you give it a try!<p>the game has:
- no ads
- no tracking of any kind
- fully offline after first load",story,https://kuboble.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
