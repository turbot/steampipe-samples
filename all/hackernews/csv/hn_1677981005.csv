35026207,Ask HN: How about we rename FAANG to MAMAA?,2023-03-05T01:25:09Z,binarynate,5,false,false,4,"[35026221,35026248,35026212]",,,,"I still hear people refer to the top tech companies as FAANG, but I think that term is outdated because Netflix is waning in relevance and two of the FAANG companies have changed their names. So, I propose that we switch from saying &quot;FAANG&quot; to &quot;MAMAA&quot; (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet). I also think this acronym is more fun to say (example: referring to big tech as &quot;big MAMAA&quot;) and maybe even a metaphor for how smaller companies are like children beholden to MAMAA&#x27;s platforms. Anyone with me?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
