We&#x27;ve been working hard on building Mimosa, and would love for you to try it! No signups required.<p>Facilitating brainstorming sessions can be a challenging and time-consuming task. It&#x27;s difficult to keep everyone on agenda, engaged, and contributing. So we&#x27;ve built Mimosa to be the easiest way to facilitate a brainstorming session.<p>Imagine if a &quot;digital whiteboard&quot; and a &quot;trello board&quot; had a baby, but built with all the best practices of professional facilitation. With Mimosa, you can minimize bias by allowing team members to contribute anonymously before revealing their ideas. This ensures that everyone has a fair chance to share their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment.<p>Once the brainstorming session is complete, you can easily view and export the final results. This allows you to keep track of a meeting&#x27;s effectiveness and share it with stakeholders.<p>But the real game-changer is our AI Brainstorming features and it&#x27;s ability to turn your 1x team into a 10x team. It help generates and collaborates with you in your brainstorming session to help you come up with more and better ideas.<p>We&#x27;re both scared and excited to hear all your thoughts, HN! :) Please do let us know any features or improvements you think we should make to help you in your meetings.",story,https://mimosa.so/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We&#x27;re a crowdsourced render farm aimed at making Blender rendering fast and affordable.
If you&#x27;ve used Blender, then I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve experienced the pain of waiting around for your animations to render. You&#x27;ve probably even had to sacrifice the quality of your work to reduce your render times. I&#x27;ve been there too.<p>Our solution to this dilemma is to leverage low opportunity cost hardware from around the world to allow Blender artists to render their projects quickly, affordably, and without compromising on quality. When artists need to create an animation, instead of lowering the quality of their work to reduce render times or paying thousands to buy or rent the hardware required, they can get fast and affordable rendering without compromising on quality.<p>We wrapped up our beta and have now launched to the public! If you&#x27;d like to try us, check out our site (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rentaflop.com) and render your Blender project quickly and affordably!<p>We posted about our beta on HN a while back, and we&#x27;ve added a lot since then. If you&#x27;d like, you can check out the past discussion here (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32838673). These are some of the features we&#x27;ve added since last time: 1. Price calculator, allowing you to see exactly what you&#x27;ll pay for a render and view sample frames to verify render correctness. 2. Blender versioned rendering, so you can choose from among several different Blender versions to render your project with. 3. File upload size limit raised to 1 GB, so you can now upload much larger projects than before. 4. Encrypted .blend files, giving you enhanced data privacy and protecting your IP during the rendering process.<p>Please leave a comment below, we&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
