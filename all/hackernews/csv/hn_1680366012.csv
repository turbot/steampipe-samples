I was wondering whether ChatGPT would know what it had been, so this morning I asked it. I&#x27;m a bit surprised that it could give such an accurate response! It said:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
212-Romance was a phone line service that was popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It allowed people to call a designated number, leave a voice message describing themselves and what they were looking for in a romantic partner, and then listen to other people&#x27;s messages. Callers could choose to respond to messages they were interested in by leaving a reply.<p>The service was named after the area code &quot;212,&quot; which was assigned to Manhattan, New York, where the phone line was initially based. 212-Romance was a precursor to modern dating services, such as online dating websites and apps, and it helped people connect with potential romantic partners in a time before widespread internet use.
