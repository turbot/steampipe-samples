Individuals need islands of stability to plan, reason and enjoy the present. Rapidly shrinking innovation, disruption and adaption cycles are destabilizing
We had all hoped automation&#x2F;AI would have removed the rat race of monotonous tasks. 
Instead a new rat race of sprinting ahead of the technology curve to remain relevant will become exhausting without extended periods of stabilization.
Those who raise such concerns are often met by proponent solutions stating that the remedy is to be &quot;upgraded&quot; so that you can keep up.
This concept alone is disturbing from its own implications. However, if we play this thought experiment forward indefinitely.
It doesn&#x27;t make sense. We still run into the question of meaning.
