34953195,Show HN: Yet another) (better) ChatGPT action for pull request code view,2023-02-27T05:05:48Z,sighingnow,1,false,false,,,,,,"chatgpt-action is designed as an AI assistant backed by chatgpt for interesting things like scoring a pull request, reviewing the patch hunks, assign labels to pull request and issues on Github.<p>Compare with existing such actions, this one has the following unique features:<p>- focus on &quot;review&quot;, rather than &quot;summarization&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t just talk about what the PR is doing, rather, it tells users how good&#x2F;bad the pull request&#x2F;changes is, and give comments about the goodness&#x2F;badness.<p>- leave useful comments only. It omits the review comments that commonly won&#x27;t appear with human reviewer from the human&#x27;s perspective.<p>- highly customizable prompt templates. It allows the prompts been configurable by users, thus it is useful for users who just want to try chatgpt with Github actions, without the effort of reinvent a wheel for the action itself.<p>This action should be a nice playground&#x2F;testbed for users who are interested in applying chatgpt on Github as an assistant. Any suggestions&#x2F;bug-reports&#x2F;improvements are appreciated!",story,https://github.com/marketplace/actions/chatgpt-action,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
