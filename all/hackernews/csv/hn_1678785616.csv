35148809,How to stop a random ware attack on an old Android,2023-03-14T08:48:00Z,CofounderWanted,1,false,false,,,,,,Years ago I was at those sights that well I should not have been on. Anytime my droid froze with a message  something about paying…. I simply took the battery out. Waited a few minutes. Put the battery back in and…..went back to those websites.<p>Other times I would disable Jave.<p>Yes some websites didn’t work. But there are plenty that do.<p>Lastly i am still a baby when it comes to code. Pistons valves mechanical stuff I know.<p>But some day when I grow up. I’d have 3 servers.<p>The 1st can’t get on the internet. Even if Tom Cruise Ethan Hunt wanted to hack it. He can’t. There are no ports.<p>The 2nd Server is a middle man or woman. It is a virtual computer and a maze. When any corrupt covert code goes into this Server. That code will excite its intentions inside a virtual computer. The Server will watch the code. If the code does anything that is not exactly in line with what has programmed in the system. It gets quarantined.<p>See if Microsoft and Apple were smart-er………and the Feds were sneaker. They could fix their computers and the internet to pinpoint any hacker hacking anyone’s computer.<p>Even if the hacker is using every computer in every country. They will be found quickly.<p>All radios went digital years ago for a reason. But I’m just a wannabe know it all.<p>Finally the 3rd Server has nothing really on it. It is the go between. When you buy something from Microsoft. The order goes through tge 1st 2 servers in a particular way. And at a particular speed.<p>So if Macho Man Savage hacked my Servers. My little snitch would see Dana or data headed toward the door.<p>Or put another way. If a server - computer is designed so that data can speed up and go slow and go back and go forward and stop and or can’t flow freely at a high rate of speed out of any server.<p>If the hacker has not programmed in these variances. Then all of that data can’t leave server number 3<p>Jumping back in time. Garage door openers were great until someone invented devices that could steal your code out of the air.<p>Then be replayed to open your garage door.<p>So programmers created code jumping technologies. The codes change every time.<p>So even if you record the code going through the air it won’t open the garage door when it’s replayed.<p>** I’d like to ad just one other tip. Years ago when I was traveling. Sometimes I would get a pop up telling me that I was not on the internet while I was! In fact on the internet watching a movie.<p>In the past. I could eliminate this problem by removing the battery and waiting a few minutes. Then the pop up would be gone and all would be good.<p>I hope this helps. Oh I forgot! Apple and Android won’t let us remove our batteries any more.<p>WTF’<p>I guess once they make it. They don’t test it. To perfect it. They just make it and forget about it.,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
