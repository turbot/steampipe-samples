Side stepping a lot of the existing players by trying different things.<p>However, it seems that the people I want feedback or investment from aren&#x27;t willing to entertain alternative ways to do something. I feel like in many cases, the reason innovation is difficult or hard to do is because people try to go after the small gaps in the process, but eventually that leads to more gaps because they&#x27;re just patching solutions in place. I don&#x27;t see the point in patches upon patches, it just means the whole thing is inefficient and sucks.<p>Sometimes, isn&#x27;t it better to re-imagine a way to do something? Its not like I&#x27;m just coming up with ideas fresh off a mushroom trip. I&#x27;ve talked to people and come up with figures that are realistic and seem possible.<p>Maybe its hard to do X today because of many entrenched players in the space who have walled gardens. Okay. But if we have a problem in mind, and we break down the problem into as many sub-problems as possible, we can find a way around these entrenched players who are too busy defending their rathole.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve only ever worked at bigger companies. At my previous job we were doing something the same way for almost 10 years (patches upon patches) to the point that customers were not interested in that feature and the company was fine letting it stagnate. I thought that if we could re-build that feature using off the shelf solutions to begin with, we could generate so many tie-ins into our existing product. Thankfully my manager believed in me and let me build a proof of concept, which was then demo&#x27;ed to higher ups in product and we ended up going all in. Today, that thing generates millions of dollars (100s I think) and brings a ton of value to customers and the business. But for almost 10 years, nobody cared or thought of doing it in a way that would actually work and fulfill its true potential.<p>I know I am naive but I can&#x27;t help but think that people just don&#x27;t want to think outside the box. I&#x27;ve encountered this in my career and now I&#x27;m encountering it in the entrepreneurship world. What am I doing wrong? Why am I so dumb to think I can just take something apart to its smallest bits and put it together in a better way?<p>Please help me because otherwise I&#x27;m just going to quit and go work at USPS or something like that and never think to innovate again. I feel so depressed and defeated.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I wanted to ask you what are your strategies, which are your decision factors.
