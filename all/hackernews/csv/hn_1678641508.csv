The world, not just the US, cannot afford &quot;run on banks&quot;.

If this were to happen the general public will lose trust in the entire US banking system, and we will see a rise of true private banks, outside the FDIC system, and that would create a separate parallel monetary system.  And who would control that?<p>The logical answer is some entity outside the US. China?<p>Only by making all the depositors whole we can assure reinforcing trust in the US banking system.<p>I am not saying to give a free pass, quite the opposite.<p>Starting with KPMG, the auditors of record, responsibility must be sought, and those individuals banned from the banking industry, and lobbying industry too, for the lifetime.<p>End of story.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
