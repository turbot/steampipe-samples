I should&#x27;ve known better. Repeatedly, I was informed by many sources that it is unwise to do so.<p>But that also makes me wonder, how exactly does large binary files slow git down?<p>If that one commit which involves the binary files is slow, that&#x27;s self-evident.<p>If cloning is slow, that&#x27;s self-evident. There&#x27;s more date to download.<p>But it seems that once the big files are in, even if they don&#x27;t get changed at all, the whole repository still slows down significantly, on almost every operation. A simple `git status` takes several seconds to complete. Neither `gc` nor `repack` could salvage that. In the end, I had to move them all to LFS, which removes all the binary files from the entire history.<p>So, why does large binary files affect git so much, even if they remain unchanged after being added?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Retail is a slow moving giant and being a fast growing startup is quite the mismatch in pace. Btw we are building a mobile checkout app with a host of features that will elevate your in-store experience, and hopefully change the retail game entirely. If you want to know more about it email me! A new landing page is in the works so the website is a bit dated right now.<p>Thanks!
