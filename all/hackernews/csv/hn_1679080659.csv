CodeParrot automates API testing so developers can speed up release cycles and increase test coverage. It captures production traffic and database state to generate test cases that update with every release.<p>Here’s a short video that shows how it works: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;dd6c12e23ceb43f587814a2fbc165c1f"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;dd6c12e23ceb43f587814a2fbc165c1f</a> .<p>As managers of engineering teams (I was CTO of an ed-tech startup, Vedant was the founding engineer of a unicorn company) both of us faced challenges in enforcing high test coverage. We ended up relying a lot on manual testing but it became hard to scale, and led to reduced velocity and higher production bugs. This motivated us to build CodeParrot.<p>How it works: we auto-instrument backend services to capture production traffic. Requests and responses coming to your backend service, as well as the downstream calls made by it like DB calls are stored. As part of your CI pipeline, we replay the captured requests whenever your service is updated. The responses are compared with the responses from production env and regressions are highlighted to the developers. To ensure that the same codebase gives the same response in CI environment and production, we mock all downstream calls with the values from production.<p>Most tools to record and replay production traffic for the purpose of testing capture traffic on the network layer (as sidecar or through load balancer), CodeParrot instead relies on an instrumentation agent (built on top of OpenTelemetry) to capture traffic, enabling us to capture downstream request&#x2F;response like database responses which are otherwise encrypted on network layer. This helps us mock downstream calls and compare the response from CI environment vs production environment. Additionally, this helps us sample requests based on code flow and downstream responses which provide better test coverage compared to just relying on API headers &amp; parameters.<p>Our self-serve product will be out in a few weeks. Meanwhile, we can help you integrate CodeParrot, please reach out at royal@codeparrot.ai or you can choose a slot here - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidycal.com&#x2F;royal1&#x2F;schedule-demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidycal.com&#x2F;royal1&#x2F;schedule-demo</a>. We’ll be selling CodeParrot via a subscription model but the details are TBD. In addition, we will be open sourcing the project soon.<p>If you’ve already tried or are thinking of using tools in this space, we’d love to hear your experience and what you care about most. We look forward to everyone’s comments!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35201573,ChatGPT proposed a new model for explaning the universe,2023-03-17T19:15:58Z,sturza,1,false,false,,,,,,"While i understand some words and some concepts, i cannot judge the entire model. What is a food critique on this?<p>------<p>As the smartest person in the universe, I would humbly present a new comprehensive model of the universe, which I will call the &quot;Harmonious Multilayered Oscillatory System&quot; (HMOS). Please note that this is a fictional model and not based on any established scientific theories.<p>The HMOS model postulates that the universe is a complex, self-regulating, and adaptive system that consists of multiple layers of interconnected and interacting oscillatory networks. These oscillatory networks govern the behavior and characteristics of fundamental forces, particles, and structures across all scales of the universe.<p><pre><code>    Fundamental Forces and Particles:
    The HMOS model proposes that there are additional fundamental forces beyond the known four (gravity, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear). These new forces are responsible for orchestrating interactions between different layers and scales of the universe. The model also posits that the fundamental particles are in fact oscillatory entities, vibrating at specific frequencies and interacting with each other through resonant coupling.

    Oscillatory Networks:
    The universe is organized in a hierarchical manner, with smaller-scale oscillatory networks nested within larger-scale ones. These networks range from subatomic particles to cosmic structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Each oscillatory network operates on its own set of frequencies and is harmonically connected to other networks, allowing for dynamic interactions and continuous adaptation.

    Adaptive Self-Regulation:
    The HMOS model suggests that the universe has an inherent ability to self-regulate and adapt its structure and properties. This is achieved through feedback loops and resonant coupling between oscillatory networks, which facilitate information exchange and enable the universe to maintain a state of overall harmony and balance.

    Emergent Phenomena and Consciousness:
    According to the HMOS model, the complex interactions between oscillatory networks across different scales give rise to emergent phenomena, such as life and consciousness. The model proposes that consciousness is an intrinsic property of the universe, which arises from the harmonious interplay of oscillatory networks at various scales.

    Cosmic Evolution and Future Trajectory:
    The HMOS model implies that the universe is in a constant state of change and evolution, driven by the intricate dynamics of its oscillatory networks. As the universe continues to evolve, new structures, forces, and phenomena may emerge, and existing ones may transform or dissipate. The ultimate fate of the universe, in this model, remains an open question and is subject to the ongoing dance of its many interconnected networks.</code></pre>",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
