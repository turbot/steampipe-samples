35107049,What can I read to convince me I shouldn’t care about online privacy as much?,2023-03-11T10:17:39Z,adaptationora,1,false,false,,,,,,"I spend a lot of time reading about and trialling alternatives to popular services to try to protect my privacy online, but it’s a struggle, because typically it costs more money to have privacy (like paying for things like Protonmail) and the services tend to be less full featured (like Protonmail, which is not even close to the same experience as Gmail).<p>So now rather than continuing to spiral with the many places I’m reading about online privacy, I thought I’d see if I can challenge my brain to just care a lot less. That would make my life simpler and less expensive.<p>Any articles, videos, whatever anyone would refer me to?<p>I just have way too much other stuff to be anxious about, so I’d rather not care about online privacy.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
