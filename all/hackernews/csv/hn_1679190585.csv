So I went into the garden and work on my feelings.<p>Here is a list of the emotions that are swelling up in me, (using the Junto Emotional Chart)<p>Awe-struck (for obvious reasons)
Astounded<p>Triumphant (the sci-fi vision has finally come true in our lifetime)<p>Perplexed (wow, how comes it&#x27;s coming at us so fast!)<p>Anxious (of the cascading effect on society, geopolitics and our business).<p>There are plenty of texts written about either the looming doom or the ultimate freedom of human capital. I am not interested in any of those abstract discussions.<p>What I do want to hear are<p>1. How are YOU feeling? 
2. Any particular changes you&#x27;ve made to your product or startup? 
3. How about your life? 
4. If you have any child&#x2F;children, your family or how you educate them?<p>Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
