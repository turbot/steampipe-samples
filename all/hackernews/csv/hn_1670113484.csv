I somehow understand how ChatGPT can generate code (it has been trained on billions of lines of code)... but I don&#x27;t fully understand how it can execute code. Execution of code requires 100% emulation of a given compiler. If X can emulate 100% a compiler, then effectively X is a compiler. Now, perhaps ChatGPT cannot execute 100% ANY Python snippet of code, but only some subset?<p>Or is it &quot;just&quot; that the AI has been trained on so much code (and the output of the code executed) that it effectively can replace a Python compiler (or any other compiler)?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
