34995222,Show HN: An open-source library for telemetry streaming started at Formula 1,2023-03-02T13:13:27Z,cha0sengine,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN, we’re open sourcing a new library called Quix Streams (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;quixio&#x2F;quix-streams)—a"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;quixio&#x2F;quix-streams)—a</a> high-performance Python and C# library that processes time-series telemetry data with message broker such as Apache Kafka, instead of a database.<p>We’re a team of engineers who all worked together at the Formula 1 McLaren pit wall. We struggled to get wanted we wanted out of existing stream processing tech, so we built our own platform called Quix. Although our original requirements were pretty niche (process over 60k data points per second), our solution is designed to make life easier for anyone who needs to process high volumes of time-series data.<p>We also wanted it to be as accessible as possible for data scientists and ML engineers (e.g. those who run a lot of physics models on sensor data). This means it’s got a lot of built-in convenience functions such as native DataFrame support and easy-to-use buffers for rolling window calculation.<p>The main differentiator though, is making it as performant as possible—we’ve added features that make it easier take full advantage of Kafka’s parallel processing capabilities while keeping relevant data together and ordered correctly.<p>So even if you’re not doing real-time ML on Formula 1 telemetry, we hope that its simplicity and performance will make you more productive and we’re excited to see what other use cases you find for it.<p>More info:<p>—[<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;quixio&#x2F;quix-streams](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;quixio&#x2F;quix-streams)"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;quixio&#x2F;quix-streams](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;q...</a><p>—[<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quix.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-sourcing-quix-streams](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quix.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-sourcing-quix-streams)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quix.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-sourcing-quix-streams](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qui...</a><p>—[<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.quix.io&#x2F;sdk-intro.html#library-features](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.quix.io&#x2F;sdk-intro.html#library-features)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.quix.io&#x2F;sdk-intro.html#library-features](https:...</a><p>* Full disclosure: the library started as a companion to our commercial platform [quix.io](<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quix.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quix.io</a>) but you can use it with any Kafka installation you like.",story,https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34995150,Show HN: Quality News – Towards a fairer ranking algorithm for Hacker News,2023-03-02T13:04:04Z,jwarden,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN!<p>TLDR;<p>- Quality News is a Hacker News client that provides additional data and insights on submissions, notably, the upvoteRate metric.<p>- We propose that this metric could be used to improve the Hacker News ranking score.<p>- In-depth explanation: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme</a><p>The Hacker News ranking score is directly proportional to upvotes, which is a problem because it creates a feedback loop: higher rank leads to more upvotes leads to higher rank, and so on...<p><pre><code>                →
             ↗     ↘
    Higher Rank   More Upvotes
             ↖     ↙
                ←
</code></pre>
As a consequence, success on HN depends almost entirely on getting enough upvotes in the first hour or so to make the front page and get caught in this feedback loop. And getting these early upvotes is largely a matter of timing, luck, and moderator decisions. And so the best stories don&#x27;t always make the front page, and the stories on the front page are not always the best.<p>Our proposed solution is to use upvoteRate instead of upvotes in the ranking formula. upvoteRate is an estimate of how much more or less likely users are to upvote a story compared to the average story, taking account how much attention the story as received, based on a history of the ranks and times at which it has been shown. You can read about how we calculate this metric in more detail here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme</a><p>About 1.5 years ago, we published an article with this basic idea of counteracting the rank-upvotes feedback loop by using attention as negative feedback. We received very valuable input from the HN community (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659</a>). Quality News has been created based largely on this feedback.<p>Currently, Quality News shows the upvoteRate metric for live Hacker News data, as well as charts of the rank and upvote history of each story. We have not yet implemented an alternative ranking algorithm, because we don&#x27;t have access to data on flags and moderator actions, which are a major component of the HN ranking score.<p>We&#x27;d love to see the Hacker News team experiment with the new formula, perhaps on an alternative front page. This will allow the community to evaluate whether the new ranking formula is an improvement over the current one.<p>We look forward discussing our approach with you!<p>Links:<p>Site: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.social-protocols.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.social-protocols.org&#x2F;</a><p>Readme: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme</a><p>Previous Blog Post: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felx.me&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;improving-the-hacker-news-ranking-algorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felx.me&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;improving-the-hacker-news-ranking...</a><p>Previous Discussion: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659</a>",story,https://news.social-protocols.org/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
