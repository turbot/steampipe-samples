Usage messages are one example. &quot;Awesome lists&quot; on GitHub are another, but they are written as unordered lists. I wonder if they would be if GFM or CommonMark supported description lists (other than through raw HTML). Do you ever miss them?<p>Pandoc and other versions of Markdown implement description lists.

Over the years, the quality of the places, the experiences, and overall value dropped significantly for me (not to mention the prices skyrocketing). So, I exclusively booked hotels for about 2 years — until today.<p>And… same experience. I paid more than I would for a hotel in hopes of getting a unique experience, but ended up getting broken furniture, an unresponsive host, unclean sheets, and other minor inconveniences.<p>Does anyone else think that Airbnb might be doomed if this keeps up? Or maybe I’ve just gotten unlucky.<p>P.S. I will say that Airbnb Experiences is pretty great. But I’m not sure how big of a revenue stream that is for them compared to accommodations.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
