We’re building Bracket (YC W22), a bidirectional ETL platform — software that syncs data two ways between your data stack and the spreadsheet tools that your business teams rely on (e.g. Google Sheets, Airtable, and Notion databases), with the ability to add transformation logic (like SQL statements or MongoDB aggregation statements) in between. (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usebracket.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usebracket.com&#x2F;</a>)<p>In other words, if you want to join columns from two Postgres tables, sync the result to an Airtable table, and allow your Airtable users to edit certain fields from either table back to Postgres, you can do that with Bracket.<p>We built this for teams that need to spin up internal tools quickly, but prefer to keep their business teams in the tools in which they operate most efficiently. For example, here are some of the use cases among our current users:
- Turn feature flags on &#x2F; off for their customers from a G Sheet
- Edit orders data in Notion
- Adjust trial periods for customers in Airtable
- Edit user info (like email) based on input sent to customer success teams
- Track and edit the status of support tickets<p>See a demo of a sync between Postgres and Airtable here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;9aa52b9f38584b2894b65bc106fba141"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;9aa52b9f38584b2894b65bc106fba141</a><p>Transparently, we are figuring out pricing and care way more about feedback which is why we don’t have a pricing page — we don’t want that to be an impediment to getting your input and building a great product.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and use cases.
