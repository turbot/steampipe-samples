For example, in my latest role, the PM will verbally or in a very short and vague document describe something that we want to build to the Engineering Manager (or to one of the engineers) and then they will gather the engineers to refine the problem by discussing possible solutions and as an outcome we will produce tickets that are ready to be picked up.<p>While this process has been working fine, we always had the same complaints, a) very vague requirements b) no documentation&#x2F;history produced during the process and as a result, in a few months we will have forgotten what we&#x27;ve done and why c) communication between engineers and stakeholders is rare and as a result, many times, the stakeholders will receive something else that what they actually needed d) very poorly written tickets description exactly because the communication is poor.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out what could be a better approach but because my experience has been the same, I&#x27;m not able to sell any alternative to the team&#x2F;stakeholders. I&#x27;ve reading about user stories and other agile-related solutions but I&#x27;m struggling to understand the nitty gritty details of such a process.<p>What is your current process and if possible, describe it in as much detail as you think someone that has never done it before will understand.<p>Thank you",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
