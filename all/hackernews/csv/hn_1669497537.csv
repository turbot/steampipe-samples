33756553,Ask HN: Why not moving on (For those laid off),2022-11-26T20:46:46Z,hinata08,1,false,false,3,[33756620],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello !<p>I&#x27;m not living in the United States, but I&#x27;ve recently read a lot of articles about layoffs at companies like GAFAMs and Tweeter.<p>I&#x27;ve also read a lot of comments about former employees looking for jobs in the same area and field, and who are sometimes struggling to keep a H1B visa.<p>Why would you keep a H1B visa or stay in the same place after a layoff ?<p>I had myself been caught in layoffs in the field that I originally studied, in 2020. And jobs that still existed back then were not well compensated.
So I decided that I would not play that game with companies. I changed of field, as well as city, and I&#x27;m now doing a snazzy job in a place that oozes companies and lacks engineers.
(I don&#x27;t know how recruiters dealt with not hiring new engineers in 2020 in my original field, and don&#x27;t care, as I&#x27;m well compensated and in a lovely area now)<p>So why do you all struggle to stay in California, despite its peak being behind ? 
Why don&#x27;t you move to Europe, India, Canada, or any place that is still hiring a lot ?
Also, why would you stay in IT ? I&#x27;m myself in IT for the previously mentioned reason, but I would have gone back to my field if massive layoffs were considered (or I would just move to MTL)<p>If companies say they don&#x27;t really need IT engineers in a place, just move where they are publicly happy to hire, or change of field !<p>EDIT : I must add I&#x27;m not advocating for layoffs and I&#x27;m not blaming workers. It&#x27;s just some kind of mutual workforce destruction deal. &quot;You companies really don&#x27;t need engineers ? Fine, we will just work in another field and loose our knowledge&quot;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Someone signed up for an Apple ID with a scrambled (random) username on that domain, and I got notified about it on my inbox.<p>This happens every few months and I have usually ignored them because my understanding is that Apple wouldn&#x27;t allow usage of that Apple ID if the email address is not verified. Since this happens every few months, I decided to act on it this time: instead of clicking on &quot;verify now&quot; on the email I received, I worked through the password reset flow and managed to set a new password to the account.<p>However, attempting to delete the Apple ID account prompts for answers to security questions, which I don&#x27;t have because I did not create the account in the first place.<p>There&#x27;s a flow to reset security questions as well, but that prompts for an answer to the existing questions.<p>In chatting with an Apple support member, there&#x27;s apparently a concept of &quot;rescue email&quot; which is different from the Apple ID and can be used to set new security question answers if the old ones are unknown. I don&#x27;t get that option which indicates that the account doesn&#x27;t have a rescue email set.<p>Since all of my available options are fruitless, I asked that the chat support member escalate my case to a higher-up and they offer to arrange of a phone support because supervisors seem to be available only on phone support. That&#x27;s not ideal for me because I am a deaf person and I don&#x27;t sign, and for the reason that I don&#x27;t want my mobile number to be associated with this Apple ID that I didn&#x27;t create.<p>At this point, I am curious to hear if anyone else has ever been in this situation and to understand how you&#x27;ve gotten out of it. I can&#x27;t imagine that this is an isolated case.<p>Disabling catch-all on my domain isn&#x27;t a solution because that&#x27;d just make me unaware of new accounts that are being created on my domain.
