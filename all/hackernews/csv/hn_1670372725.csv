It didn’t get much traction, perhaps because it was a Vox article, but I was looking forward to discussion in the comments because I was surprised how much I agreed with its premise.<p>Link to previous thread: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33875899<p>This article reviewed on several components of the current economy over the past few years. More from my own brain, here’s my list of “weird” aspects of our current economy:<p>* soaring and stagnating housing sector
* tumult in the Stock market (soaring 20&#x2F;21, tumbling 2022)
* plateau consumer spending, consumer still “holding in”
* Inflation and increase in consumer spending. Related: the end of cheap debt.
* Supply chain chaos
* Popular sentiment and reporting of looming recession
* Uncertainties in global markets, major international relations crises
* Crypto (let’s not get too caught up in this one, pretty please) 
* Strong employment<p>I’m coming from a US perspective, and asking more as a sentiment of person opinions rather than a desire to debate and analyze and analyze a topic as complex as this one, or the dubiousness of answering such a question.<p>I do think the economy is weird, and I admit I do expect tougher times are ahead, but I don’t have any idea whether to expect stagnation, recession, or worse.
