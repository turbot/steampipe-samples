I don&#x27;t work a lot, tasks are mostly straightforwards, my team and my manager are all nice people to work with. But...pay sucks.<p>There&#x27;s this shiny startup that offers me a 100% raise and tremendous benefits. The founders are really nice, have industry experience and seem to know what they&#x27;re doing and have been doing it for a few years. But I can sense that the bar is higher, in terms of quality of delivery notably.<p>On one hand I&#x27;m excited for this opportunity that is life changing because of the money alone. Also I&#x27;ll learn and grow a lot as a SWE. They use tools and paradigms I&#x27;ve only ever read about on HN so I&#x27;ll have to spend time learning all that, maybe read books and watch videos on my spare time. On the other hand my life is...peaceful right now?<p>What I&#x27;m most afraid of is to be let go after 2-3 months because I&#x27;m can&#x27;t meet their standard which from the interviews I had with them appear to be higher than my workplace. They also value people who take initiatives and these recent years I&#x27;ve mostly done what I&#x27;ve been told to. I&#x27;ve never been fired for performance reason in the past but I did quit a company at the beginning of my career because I was lagging behind.<p>I also started my present job in last October and I start to feel comfortable in this new role. And most of all I would dread having to go through another wave of interviews if I lose that new job.<p>I tried thinking of what I want. I always imagined I&#x27;ll find a stable, straightforward job at some point in my career. Which I now have. But I&#x27;m also underpaid. My compensation used to be higher last year, before being laid off. This setback is causing a significant delay in my savings and retirement plans. That new job pays more than I have ever been paid. I just turned 34 and I feel this might be the last time I have the energy to join a team like that.<p>I want to jump and try, and if I do it I need to shift my mindset and be prepared to put in a bit more effort.<p>Any advice?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
