35231603,Envio: The Secure CLI Tool for Managing Environment Variables,2023-03-20T14:00:37Z,humblepenguin,1,false,false,1,[35231803],,,,"Hey everyone,<p>I just wanted to share with you my latest creation: envio! It&#x27;s a command-line tool that makes managing environment variables a breeze.<p>So, what makes envio different from other tools out there? Well, for starters, envio uses the concept of profiles to store your environment variables. A profile is simply a collection of environment variables that you can easily switch between depending on your needs. For example, you might have a &quot;development&quot; profile with variables specific to your local development environment, and a &quot;production&quot; profile with variables for your live site.<p>But here&#x27;s where things get really cool: envio allows you to import profiles from the internet and files, and export your profiles to files as well. This makes it easy to share your profiles with others or use them across different projects. Plus, all profiles are encrypted, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about sensitive information being exposed.<p>Using envio is simple too. Just create a profile, add some variables, and switch between profiles as needed. You can even set a default profile for your shell so that it&#x27;s always available.<p>Overall, I think envio is a great tool for anyone who works with environment variables on a regular basis. It&#x27;s secure, flexible, and easy to use. Plus, it&#x27;s open-source and available on GitHub, so you can contribute to the project if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Give envio a try and let me know what you think! You can find the GitHub link here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;humblepenguinn&#x2F;envio<p>Thanks for reading!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
