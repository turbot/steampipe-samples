Maybe some tools for geolocation since I have friends in different cities.<p>I&#x27;m a bit introverted, and so often go long stretches of time forgetting to reach out to people to organise things - feels like this would be a tool to broadcast &quot;I&#x27;d like to meet-up this week if anyone else would!&quot; to reduce that which would otherwise need to be 1:1 messages to individual friends&#x2F;groups.<p>I tried searching the Play store and google for similar functionality, but all I kept coming across were apps for finding&#x2F;meeting new friends, generally all run by for-profit companies.<p>It&#x27;s something I&#x27;d be interested in creating, but would rather just use if it already exists.
