This industry is small in numbers, but the clients are banks and lenders, so high potential value.<p>There is still development work to be done, but looking ahead, I&#x27;m starting to think about a business model which could monetise these tools. So far, I&#x27;ve thought of a couple of different models, and would appreciate any thoughts or input regarding them or additional options.<p>1. Sell the software directly. I&#x27;m not sure this is the correct approach, as the tools are aimed at IC&#x27;s in the space, to be used interactively and in production to build and deploy models (think of it as a toolkit to be used directly in Python). There are complexities with licensing, and the code would need to be source-open to the customer due to the nature of Python packages.<p>2. Open source the project and sell consulting work to integrate the tools into lenders. The main issue with this approach is the limited number of potential customers (estimated around 30). If even a handful use the software without engaging in other paid work, it&#x27;s a significant chunk of the potential market.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
