34767180,Ask HN: Is there an easy way to automate animation tests that include UI?,2023-02-12T21:27:14Z,rikroots,2,false,false,,,,,,"Is there an (easy|simple|sane) [pick one from 3] way to automate animation tests that include User Interaction?<p>I ask because earlier this evening I deployed an update&#x2F;NPM version bump of my Canvas library, after spending much of the day reviewing all the demo tests in various browsers on various devices. Only to watch as the new version broke the library&#x27;s associated website&#x27;s build tools. A stupid bug (2 chars) which meant having to fix it, test essential demos in various browsers etc before doing another release on GitHub and publishing the new version on NPM.<p>I know this process can be easier. But the thing that holds me back from automating the heck out of my test&#x2F;release process is that I&#x27;m clueless about how to test the library&#x27;s functionality. It&#x27;s a library to make working with 2D Canvas elements &quot;more fun&quot;, so I test manually because I need to *see* that things - in particular animations - are working as I expect them to work.<p>The test suite is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrawl-v8.rikweb.org.uk&#x2F;demo&#x2F;index.html<p>Any advice is really welcome!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
