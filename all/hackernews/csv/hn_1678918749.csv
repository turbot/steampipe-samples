I last rented a car in 2017 and the experience was fine. I got a new phone number since then so I updated my new details and verified them.<p>Then I was suddenly unable to log in. When I entered my credentials on the screen I was given an error message: &quot;You’re no longer eligible for membership. Please contact support if you have any questions.&quot;<p>Thinking this was a mistake I contacted Turo customer support and I was responded to with this vague message:<p>---<p>Hello [name],<p>We truly appreciate your interest in Turo. We gave your account a second look and we’re sorry to say we&#x27;re unable to unrestrict it. Our initial decision is final.<p>We don’t make these decisions lightly and I want to reiterate that we consider many factors when determining eligibility including one or more of the following:
- Failed background screening
- One or more motor vehicle record (MVR) violations
- Risk flags triggered by Turo’s internal system
- Violation of Turo’s Terms of Service<p>We appreciate your understanding,<p>Alex
Turo Verification Team<p>---<p>I checked the banning policies on their site and found this statement:<p>&quot;If you violate a Turo policy, one of our Community Guidelines, or Turo’s Terms of Service, we’ll notify you via email. The email will specify what rule you broke, whether you can appeal our decision, and when. Unless the email we sent you says you can submit an appeal, our decision is final and can’t be reversed.&quot;<p>I never received any notice and no reason for the ban. I never did anything with Turo for a number of years, no arrests, no convictions, no tickets, nothing. I just recently got the phone number and I know someone else had this phone number before me so perhaps they sullied it&#x27;s reputation?<p>I find it very odd for a legitimate company like Turo to permanently ban someone after &quot;careful consideration&quot; even though I have done nothing with the company for 5 years and they never contacted me.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
