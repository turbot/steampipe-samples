What&#x27;s funny: 1) I&#x27;ve heard from him that he taught C++, data mining etc at various local colleges and some universities and about his students, but he never told what he has _built_ with his code; 2) he wrote some article of type how-the-brain-works + fuzzy set theory to explain how the brain recognizes speech phonemes etc, but he wasn&#x27;t able to pronounce &quot;Ruby&quot; correctly; 3) despite teaching programming languages he is not able to learn English proficiently enough, saying that he is too old to learn any other language.<p>When I told that I want to build a website, he sent me some master&#x27;s degree paperworks of his students who built sites for some bs companies, but I am not interested in their industries and would never be fully motivated to build any websites for such companies. One of the advantages is that he may have some connections regarding the local work opportunities, but some of his connections keep reiterating that to get a programming job you always need some certificate of completion of some locally (Baltic EU) tought courses. When I told about HackerRank, numerous online CS learning platforms etc, there was no reaction.<p>Should I waste my time and attention on this? How can I stop this idiotic circus?<p>I am tired of all this idiotic circus. I am happy enough by teaching my self CS myself, despite that I havn&#x27;t made any money with it. I know exactly why it is so, and how to change it. I love my own original interpretation of CS foundations and concepts. I think it is very unique and you won&#x27;t find it in any current textbook. I can design enough interesting&#x2F;useful coding tasks for myself by using online resources and I have more than enough free and paid resources online and offline textbooks to teach my self CS myself seamlessly.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
