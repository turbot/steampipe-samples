35108724,Ask HN: Anyone else feel the idea is more difficult than execution?,2023-03-11T14:57:25Z,bumblewax,2,false,false,,[35108904],,,,"Ok so this isn’t an entirely serious stance. A poorly (or not at all) executed idea will amount to nothing. But I can’t help wondering if others feel like I do and find it incredibly difficult to find ideas worthy of spending a lot of time on.<p>I’m an engineer and love building things. It feels like I can build anything or at the very least learn what I need to in order to have a serious shot at building something. How do you get from here to the point where there’s a spark that, with enough pivots, can lead to something that adds value? I’ve built and shipped things in the past. Procrastination isn’t my problem (I think).<p>I’ve digested pg’s essays on the topic and anything else I could find. This is a bit of privileged whining from my end, but would love to hear others thoughts.<p>Hope everyone has a great weekend!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
