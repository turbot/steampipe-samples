35223553,Ask HN: Semantic” CSS Framework?,2023-03-19T20:59:22Z,PaulHoule,1,false,false,,,,,,"When I make applications on my own account that are server-side rendered I frequently use CSS to style things in a way similar to what I think CSS was intended for initially,  that is,  I apply styles to meaningful parts of the document (e.g. &quot;div.statusbar&quot;, &quot;table.postlisting th&quot;.)<p>Frequently I work on these things on and off for months or years and eventually they become a hot mess.<p>I&#x27;m looking for something that will help me have some discipline.  I <i>do not</i> like BEM, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and other frameworks that want to impose alien structures on CSS.  I like the intention of SASS&#x2F;SCSS but don&#x27;t like the idea of complicating my build system.  (I like the idea of CSS Nesting as it works in Chrome but Firefox doesn&#x27;t have it yet unfortunately.  I want to use the latest features but I need support for Firefox and Mobile Safari with Chrome as a distant third.)  I would consider using a JS polyfill and I am using jinja2 template so anything I can bake into my python back end (maybe compile &amp; cache compiled CSS) would be possible.<p>Any advice for frameworks or other organizing principles?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
