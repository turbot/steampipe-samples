I made this repo purely for educational&#x2F;fun purpose since it only supports 4 basic arithmetic operators and nested sub-expressions (to make it slightly more challenging :P).<p>Then I had the idea to extend the unit tests with Hypothesis (Python&#x27;s property based unit testing library) and it found an edge case in my simple implementation that I thought had it covered via unit tests!<p>Sharing this repo just in case anyone finds it interesting (esp. the hypothesis test file.)",story,https://github.com/beyonddream/calculator,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
