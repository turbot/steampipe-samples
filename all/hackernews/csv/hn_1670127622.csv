because almost all of these text fields provide only very basic editing functions.<p>A while ago, I came up with an idea: what if we could use Vim as an IME?<p>Ordinary IMEs are used to input some non-English characters, but the essential functions of IME are
1) receiving a keyboard sequence
2) process the key sequence and outputting a text<p>These functions are the same as text editor&#x27;s.
So I thought implementing an IME that can be used with Vim keybindings could be a good solution for the above problem.<p>After that I learned mechanisms of IME for Linux desktop and tried to develop an experimental IME.",story,https://github.com/algon-320/vime,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
