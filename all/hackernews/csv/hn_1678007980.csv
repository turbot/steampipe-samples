Now 30 years later, our software stack is so much more complex with each piece of open source software being composed of countless other pieces by developers from all around the world and all walks of life.<p>How does everybody protect their host OS from all that untrusted code when you try a piece of open source software?<p>Is it reasonably secure to run it in a Docker container?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35027908,Ask HN: How to identify a good quality electronics,2023-03-05T08:30:14Z,colinjoy,2,false,false,,,,,,"The market seems to be full of white label products sold by no-name asian vendors and established brands alike. You get the exact same box with a different logo slapped onto it, or you get a different box with the same internal components.<p>What are resources that you use and recommend for doing due diligence before buying? I get that there is people who don&#x27;t worry on spending $30 on cheap electronics - if it is no good or breaks quickly, &quot;it was cheap - easy to move on to the next disposable, mass produced gadget&quot;. I would also not worry too much about the loss of $30 (apart from not wanting to contribute to excessive electronic scrap), BUT when that gadget (say a USB hub) is going to be connected to a &gt;$4000 setup, I really don&#x27;t want it to fry it&#x27;s neighbours.<p>Comments on amazon are useless and people writing about gear they own, often do so from a position of shallow experience.<p>Sometimes I stumble across great teardowns [1][2], but that is rather the exception.<p>Where do you look for such information?
