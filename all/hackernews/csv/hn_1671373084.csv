34037780,Tell HN: Musk's aircraft are not using PIA transponder codes,2022-12-18T14:11:47Z,_djo_,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Musk, and many of those defending him, keep claiming[0] that his aircraft are part of the FAA&#x27;s Privacy ICAO aircraft address (PIA) program[1]. And that therefore ElonJet or anyone else tracking them is doing more than just republishing public information.<p>It&#x27;s false: None of the aircraft Musk has been using are currently enrolled in PIA or have been recently, and you can verify that for yourself.<p>What PIA does is assign you a fresh ICAO hex code every 60 days, without a link in the FAA registry, for each aircraft in the program. You are then responsible for keying that code into your aircraft&#x27;s transponder while it&#x27;s active. If you don&#x27;t change the transponder code there&#x27;s no additional privacy.<p>This is what an aircraft in the PIA programme looks like: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?icao=a0fe01<p>Note the &#x27;PIA&#x27; flag and lack of additional information that would normally be pulled from the registry. In fact, if you convert that to the registration using an online lookup tool[2] you get N163NB, a fake record.[3]<p>Musk uses three jets, N628TS, N272BG, and N502SX. None are using PIA codes and all are easily visible on ADSB Exchange and most importantly have their ICAO hex codes listed publicly on the FAA registry, along with ownership information.<p>In fact, N628TS is airborne right now using its original assigned ICAO hex code of A835AF, not a PIA code.<p>Perhaps his aircraft have used PIA codes in the past, but they&#x27;re not using them now.<p>In our discussions on HN we should at least be able to agree on basic facts like these, without repeating the claims made by those with an interest in confusing the issue.<p>N628TS:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?icao=a835af<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.faa.gov&#x2F;aircraftinquiry&#x2F;Search&#x2F;NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=628TS<p>N272BG:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?icao=a2ae0a<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.faa.gov&#x2F;aircraftinquiry&#x2F;Search&#x2F;NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=272BG<p>N502SX:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globe.adsbexchange.com&#x2F;?icao=a64304<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.faa.gov&#x2F;aircraftinquiry&#x2F;Search&#x2F;NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=502SX<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;elonmusk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1603803508087537665<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faa.gov&#x2F;air_traffic&#x2F;technology&#x2F;equipadsb&#x2F;privacy<p>[2] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avionictools.com&#x2F;icao.php<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.faa.gov&#x2F;aircraftinquiry&#x2F;Search&#x2F;NNumberResult?NNumberTxt=163NB",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

  * A little more room around headings
  * Top menu bar is full-width and with a little more padding
  * Downvoted comments no longer faint hard-to-read grey. Instead they&#x27;re rendered with a light gray background and in a smaller font size.
  * Comments have a more readable max line length
  * Quotes are parsed and transformed to look like genuine quotes. I.e. any p or span that starts with &#x27;&gt;&#x27; is transformed and rendered with a light orange background and in italics.
  * The &#x27;Add comment&#x27; box on items is hidden by default. (Surely you&#x27;d want to read all the comments first before leaping in with your own 2p&#x27;s worth!?)

But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.<p>The problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.<p>What I was thinking was:
- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)
- Make it as vanilla as possible
- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18
- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc<p>Is this solved elegantly on any other languange or framework?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
