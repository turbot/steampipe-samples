I bought one at the recent Black Friday sale: $1,700 for a 12 Gen i7-1280P, 32GB, 512GB SSD. I love this machine.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lenovo.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;laptops&#x2F;thinkpad&#x2F;thinkpadx1&#x2F;thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-10-(14-inch-intel)&#x2F;21cbcto1wwus2<p>Physically, it&#x27;s fantastic. Hats off to the engineers and designers for investing in the tactile experience. They made it lightweight but simultaneously substantial-feeling via rigidity and weight distribution. I now understand why Thinkpad keyboards are so well-regarded. Its trackpad matches Apple&#x27;s, which is the highest praise I can give. The brilliant screen has an aspect ratio that&#x27;s as good for building things as for consuming content. And battery life supports hours of binging netflix after compiling a bunch of code.<p>I&#x27;ve been even more pleasantly surprised by the software experience. This is a Linux workstation that &quot;just works.&quot; Close the lid, it goes on standby - open, and it resumes instantly. Plug it into a 100Mhz ultrawide monitor via a lightning cable, and not only does it seamlessly extend the desktop at native refresh rates, but it also mounts all the devices that are connected via the monitor&#x27;s integrated USB hub. I&#x27;m able to log in via my bluetooth kinesis keyboard consistently, without hassle. Updates are fast, easy, and tested on the exact hardware I&#x27;m using. I&#x27;ve been using it as my daily driver for a week and I&#x27;ve yet to dive down a rabbit-hole of outdated forum advice to get something basic to work.<p>Finally, and more subjectively, Fedora&#x27;s out-of-the-box experience handily outshines both OSX and Windows. Window-snapping, global search, software installation via a package manager, resource efficiency, containerization support, configuration, etc.<p>I wanted to share here for any others who have tried, and failed, to find a legitimately better-than-Macbook development machine for the past few years.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
