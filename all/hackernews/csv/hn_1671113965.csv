I feel like if I worked at a big company and stared at good code all day long I would have learned a lot by now.<p>I&#x27;ve read about things like &quot;Single responsibility principle&quot; or &quot;Open-Closed Principle&quot; which... while reading about it seems nice, it&#x27;s always way more tricky in real life to apply (at least for me).<p>Looking at very simple &quot;make_payment(user, 1000)&quot; examples where the payment is consolidated into one line of code never helps me... in my experience, and the thing which I feel is hardest for my brain to wrap my head around, is when some parts of code is used in multiple areas, but there is no &quot;clean break.&quot; Like say a &quot;quick add to cart&quot; function on a website... it might need to do all the following:<p>validate the cart, use toast modal dependencies with a custom message, track all items that were added to the cart, send different params to the backend, etc etc<p>This may be 80% similar to the &quot;add to cart&quot; so there could be a series of functions that seem easily &#x27;shared&#x27;, but then of course some other edge case will come up where I need to not track something now, so now do I make another function with duplication? Do I just keep adding arguments to a large already very confusing function?<p>Things like this I generally fumble my way through until it &quot;feels right,&quot; as in I have a good intuition by now what will be a headache, and what wont. But I have no method to my madness, I just try to separate things as best I can but UNDOUBTEDLY there will be 89253 different &quot;special cases&quot; that make it very difficult to do it cleanly without either duplication, excessive arguments, excessively long functions, etc.<p>I do use OOP languages, and javascript primarily.<p>I want to just read a book or watch a course with GOOD examples. I absolutely dont feel my code is &quot;bad&quot;, and I have managed some complex projects, but its not exceptionally good and that&#x27;s where I want it to be.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
