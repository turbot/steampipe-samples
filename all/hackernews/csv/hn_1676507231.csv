34812656,Are AI language models being used to flood us with hype?,2023-02-15T23:44:01Z,vba616,3,false,false,1,[34813073],,,,"I&#x27;m finding it inexplicable the gap between what everybody writes recently and actually using ChatGPT.<p>I asked it something like &quot;give me suggestions for distinguishing situation X from not-X probabilistically with data from a smartphone&#x27;s sensor array&quot;.<p>It gives me a bunch of plausible suggestions, but  the bullet points look suspiciously like an embellished list of all of the commonly used sensors on a phone. (why shouldn&#x27;t it...)<p>So I decide to zero in on one of them arbitrarily, and I ask it to characterize the probability distribution for sensor Y, in the &quot;X&quot; and &quot;not-X&quot; case (I&#x27;m not wording it like I do here, so don&#x27;t jump to conclusions)<p>Then it says, contradicting the earlier response, that really, you can&#x27;t expect any difference between X and not-X <i>and</i> it avoids giving anything quantitative. It smoothly describes a distribution centered around zero with a small variance, but that&#x27;s the very opposite of helpful.<p>Ok, but I keep reading that it&#x27;s very useful if you know how to prompt it, if you break things down into smaller steps, and so on.<p>So next I ask it to provide me some of the competing sources for the two contradictory claims, that the output of sensor Y is, or is not, differing depending on X. If ChatGPT can&#x27;t <i>understand</i> its sources, perhaps I can read them.<p>And it gives me a really nice looking result, with three citations and hyperlinks for each.<p>But thennnnn...I click on the links. First for the less probable claim that sensor Y can determine X. Two go nowhere (possibly related to having numbers in the URL) and the third goes to a completely unrelated study about...cats.<p>Ok, but I know what you want to say...you want to say it&#x27;s still useful if you can see the <i>other</i> three links <i>aren&#x27;t</i> garbage. Alas, it didn&#x27;t work that way. None of them was verifiable, and the only one that wasn&#x27;t verifiably worthless went to a very large and paywalled document, impossible to be sure about. I would bet the contents aren&#x27;t even in the training data though.<p>Next I pointed out the invalid links supporting what I wanted to be true, that sensor Y is useful for my purpose. ChatGPT immediately groveled, as it does, saying it had reviewed all the information, and I was correct, and there was nothing on the internet supporting its original suggestion.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t help! You can&#x27;t prove a negative, and it obviously <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> done any sort of search. I stated that, but it apparently was stuck in its local min&#x2F;max, I suppose due to the prior conversation.<p>At this point it seems clear to me that these language models are simply ELIZA combined with a method for auto-generating language rules from data instead of a hand-written script.<p>But everything I read to the contrary is leading to a sense of derealization. Are the people who are writing what seems like fan-fiction trying to fool others? Or are they fooled? Or am I?<p>One thing seems clear to me - the tone or flavor of ChatGPT content, that seems both inhuman and annoying when trying to get anything useful out of it, does not seem new to me. A great deal of online journalism for quite some time resembles it in my opinion, take it for what you will.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
