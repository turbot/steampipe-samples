It&#x27;s substantially different from the version I originally shared, at this point.<p>Some highlights for dev ergonomics:
- Unejected create-react-app w&#x2F; typescript for the front-end
- Themeable semantic-ui component library tied into the hot-reload loop
- json-web-token based user sessions, including middleware with token refresh
- sql bindings via sqlc (autogenerates db mocks, too, all hot-reload)
- server-side rendering with a sidecar container (prerender)
- stubbed out backend &quot;worker&quot; container for async tasks
- pre-baked database migration pattern<p>This has been a really productive (and performant!) starter project for me - hopefully it&#x27;s useful to others.",story,https://github.com/karlkeefer/pngr,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
