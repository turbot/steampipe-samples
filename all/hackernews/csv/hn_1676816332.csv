They usually claim things like collaboration is way better in person, socialization is much needed, if you spend 8h&#x2F;day with your coworkers then they ultimately become almost friends, productivity seems to be lower when WFH, etc.<p>My bet is that most of the people who thinks like this are probably in their 20s. I’m not in my 20s anymore, and I couldn’t care less about all the claims above. I’m a professional that takes his career seriously (I didn’t study CS for the money, over here they don’t pay that much either), and I study every day to become better because I just like it… but I have zero empathy for companies that want to micromanage me and for coworkers that want me to be their friends and share food time.<p>I have more important commitments in life than being physically around my coworkers sharing an open office space, yet I can successfully and professionally do my job. I understand companies wanting us to go back to the office (they are businesses looking for revenue, they are not our friends), but it really causes me pain to see how many employees do not mind at all going back to a way of working that diminishes quality of life.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
