It&#x27;s not &quot;just to convince you guys that I wrote something cool&quot;. My book is pretty mediocre.<p>However in order to write it, I rented a hotel (!) in a different country because I couldn&#x27;t find a quiet place where I could do this. And spent here ~1.5 month writing it.<p>I&#x27;m highly inspired by two guys. Those guys who wrote RefactoringUI (Adam Wathan &amp; Steve Schoger) and Josh W Comeau (who made css-for-developers). Both of them made terrific products.<p>My dream is to get to their level.<p>But here is a thing: I planned to spend a whole year for this book, but due to the war (I&#x27;m from Russia) I had to migrate to another country. And a lot of things has happened. After suffering depressing (hello Fluvoxamine &amp; Xanax), I finally made something that I can show.<p>If I get some results (yes, basically, sells), I&#x27;ll dedicate the next year to get close to those guys mentioned above.<p>One of the ideas is to write a book (or even a course) about tables. They are complicated.<p>Another one is to upgrade <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.user-interface.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.user-interface.io&#x2F;</a> to a printed book.<p>Many ideas, but it&#x27;s hard to realize that the whole year was hectic due to the well-known sad events that happened.<p>One thing I want to mention about &quot;what&#x27;s cool about this offer&quot;. In the &quot;Complete package&quot; there is a discount for FramesX.<p>It&#x27;s the first time I used a product in Figma and I used it for my illustrations. Next week this guy releases the second version. And I RELALY liked this one. So that might be even better than offer than my book :D",story,http://reform.user-interface.io,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
