That&#x27;d be terrible design, since this is a commercial-grade unit the size of a small fridge, I assume it does not work like that.<p>A nicer way would be if the dose of ground coffee is matched to the cup size, so that a large and small &quot;strong&quot; would taste the same.<p>Since more water runs through for a large cup, the machine must grind and load a larger dose of coffee into the brewing unit, than it does when it&#x27;s making a small cup of the same strength..<p>But, if this is the case, then there are unexposed strengths available for the &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;small&quot; sizes!
I basically want the strongest brew available, if I had the patience (and I sometimes do) I&#x27;ll simply fill my mug with espresso..<p>Lots of interfaces in the world are like this.. they hide useful information from the user, the excuse is always &quot;not to confuse the poor stupid users&quot;, but it takes away usable features from the product and options from the user... Why shouldn&#x27;t I be able to run a small cup amount of water through the dose of coffee intended for a &quot;strong&quot; amount of coffee, giving me an cup extra-extra strong brew ?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
