35042662,Show HN: Open-Source Alternative to Loom,2023-03-06T16:05:21Z,jayfk,5,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN, we&#x27;re excited to introduce Sorbay - an open source alternative to Loom for creating and sharing screen recordings.<p>With Sorbay, you can easily record your screen, camera, and microphone all at once. It is a complete solution that comes with its own backend service, allowing you to instantly share a link of your recording as soon as it is finished. The video is streamed directly to the backend service as the recording happens to make this possible.<p>With both founders based in different countries, we needed a tool to quickly share screen recordings to keep us up to date or to ask for feedback. Meetings are cool if you need to discuss something deeply, but for almost everything else a quick recording works better.<p>We had to settle for one of the proprietary solutions because none of the open source tools allowed us to quickly share something with each other. Doing the recording is one aspect, but having the ability to instantly share a link was crucial. Waiting on a 400mb video upload to a Dropbox is just too much interruption if you want to quickly share something.<p>The tipping point for us to actually build this open source tool came via an interaction from one of our day jobs. A third party provider sent a screen recording full of confidential information and to make things worse, all of it was uploaded by them to a different third party service. We strongly believe that information like this should stay within a company, ideally on infrastructure that they control themselves. Having a fully integrated open source solution is the best way to go for this.<p>Our goal with this first public release is to gather feedback. The critical code paths are working, but it is still a bit rough to use. We deliberately 
cut out all non-essential features, but have a clear roadmap on what we want to release this year.<p>There are a couple of known issues like audio glitches, non-working videos in Safari and crashing binaries that we hope to fix in the coming weeks. Later this 
year, we plan on releasing a cloud hosted version of Sorbay that would let you connect your own S3 storage provider. Additionally, we will be releasing an on-prem option focused on features for enterprises (SSO, RBAC, compliance).<p>Both the Sorbay Client and the backend service are completely open source. For licensing we choose the AGPLv3 throughout the stack. The client is built 
with Vue.js on top of Electron. The use of Electron might be a bit controversial here on Hackernews but given the resources we currently have that was 
the only way that allowed us to get a working client out on all major platforms. The backend service is realized with Django. We use Keycloak for 
authentication and Minio for S3 compatible storage. All of this is run alongside Postgres and Redis, running on Docker containers which are managed by Docker Compose.<p>We invite you to try Sorbay for yourself and join us on our issue tracker[1][2], Slack channel[3] or here on HN.<p>Thanks for checking out Sorbay!<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sorbayhq&#x2F;sorbay"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sorbayhq&#x2F;sorbay</a>

35042316,Show HN: Up to 100x Faster FastAPI with simdjson and io_uring on Linux 5.19,2023-03-06T15:41:23Z,ashvardanian,51,false,false,13,"[35042609,35042733,35042699,35042807,35042709]",,,,"A few months ago, I benchmarked FastAPI on an i9 MacBook Pro. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. A primary REST endpoint to `sum` two integers took 6 milliseconds to evaluate. It is okay if you are targeting a server in another city, but it should be less when your client and server apps are running on the same machine.<p>FastAPI would have bottleneck-ed the inference of our lightweight UForm neural networks recently trending on HN under the title &quot;Beating OpenAI CLIP with 100x less data and compute&quot;. (Thank you all for the kind words!) So I wrote another library.<p>It has been a while since I have written networking libraries, so I was eager to try the newer io_uring networking functionality added by Jens Axboe in kernel 5.19. TLDR: It&#x27;s excellent! We used pre-registered buffers and re-allocated file descriptors from a managed pool. Some other parts, like multi-shot requests, also look intriguing, but we couldn&#x27;t see a flawless way to integrate them into UJRPC. Maybe next time.<p>Like a parent with two kids, we tell everyone we love Kernel Bypass and SIMD equally. So I decided to combine the two, potentially implementing one of the fastest implementations of the most straightforward RPC protocol - JSON-RPC. ~~Healthy and Fun~~ Efficient and Simple, what can be better?<p>By now, you may already guess at least one of the dependencies - `simdjson` by Daniel Lemiere, that has become the industry standard. io_uring is generally very fast, even with a single core. Adding more polling threads may only increase congestion. We needed to continue using no more than one thread, but parsing messages may involve more work than just invoking a JSON parser.<p>JSON-RPC is transport agnostic. The incoming requests can be sent over HTTP, pre-pended by rows of headers. Those would have to be POSTs and generally contain Content-Length and Content-Type. There is a SIMD-accelerated library for that as well. It is called `picohttpparser`, uses SSE, and is maintained by H2O.<p>The story doesn&#x27;t end there. JSON is limited. Passing binary strings is a nightmare. The most common approach is to encode them with base-64. So we took the Turbo-Base64 from the PowTurbo project to decode those binary strings.<p>The core implementation of UJRPC is under 2000 lines of C++. Knowing that those lines connect 3 great libraries with the newest and coolest parts of Linux is enough to put a smile on my face. Most people are more rational, so here is another reason to be cheerful.<p>- FastAPI throughput: 3&#x27;184 rps.
- Python gRPC throughput: 9&#x27;849 rps.
- UJRPC throughput:
-- Python server with io_uring: 43&#x27;000 rps.
-- C server with POSIX: 79&#x27;000 rps.
-- C server with io_uring: 231&#x27;000 rps.<p>Granted, this is yet to be your batteries-included server. It can&#x27;t balance the load, manage threads, spell S in HTTPS, or call parents when you misbehave in school. But at least part of it you shouldn&#x27;t expect from a web server.<p>After following the standardization process of executors in C++ for the last N+1 years, we adapted the &quot;bring your runtime&quot; and &quot;bring your thread-pool&quot; policies. HTTPS support, however, is our next primary objective.<p>---<p>Of course, it is a pre-production project and must have a lot of bugs. Don&#x27;t hesitate to report them. We have huge plans for this tiny package and will potentially make it the default transport of UKV: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unum-cloud&#x2F;ukv"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unum-cloud&#x2F;ukv</a>",story,https://github.com/unum-cloud/ujrpc,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
