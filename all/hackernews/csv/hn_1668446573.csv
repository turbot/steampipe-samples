Over the past 3 years, I&#x27;ve been building Podcastpage.io, a full website platform for podcasters and audio&#x2F;video creators.<p>I&#x27;ve seen many website popular solutions over the years, and those are really great generally (Webflow&#x2F;Squarespace&#x2F;Wix&#x2F;WordPress) but are also very broad&#x2F;generic. This makes it a little more complex to use, and also these lack support for niche use-cases.<p>When you need more flexibility and automations around media, it simply gets too complicated. Imaging syncing a podcast or YouTube channel with 1,000&#x27;s of episodes to an existing website (with their own page URLs), and making sure all future episodes are going to be imported too. Then, setting up an audio&#x2F;video player could be a challenge, and you&#x27;ll end up spending more time and money with a generic website platform.<p>That&#x27;s why I decided to build Podcastpage - It&#x27;s laser-focused on helping podcasters and creators with their projects, and establish their online presence via a proper website.<p>Being focused on one niche doesn&#x27;t mean the product is necessarily limited or very basic (a-la LinkTree). I&#x27;ve worked hard to ensure the user gets full flexibility when building the site (by using a drag &amp; drop page editor) and at the same time, make their experience flawless and easy.<p>If you have a podcast &#x2F; YouTube channel, give Podcastpage a try - you won&#x27;t regret it.<p>Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!",story,https://podcastpage.io,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
