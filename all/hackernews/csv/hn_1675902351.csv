34717676,Ask HN: What to do when engineering details are now tedious?,2023-02-09T00:06:03Z,tinktank,2,false,false,1,[34717858],,,,"Hello HN,<p>I just got off a two hour call where 30 engineers provided feedback on terminology being used to write a spec.  This is important, and I get its important.  I just sat there getting increasingly resentful on why this wasn&#x27;t an emailed link on which people could comment?<p>Yesterday, I sat through an hour long presentation in which we got three slides through.  It was on a protocol for data transfer but as soon as the speaker got past the intro and into the overview slides there were a million questions and suggestions on why he should have done things differently.  I left wondering why didn&#x27;t they at least let him finish? Most of the answers were on the subsequent slides.<p>On Friday, I was outlining a plan for a connection setup protocol in host software to a colleague who kept on objecting to various issues, and for every issue I&#x27;d address he&#x27;d bring up yet another issue.  After about 35 mins I realized he wanted to do it in firmware; as soon as I did I called him on it, and presented my alternate design for firmware -- he then spent 60 mins objecting to every detail only to end up with the same protocol except the field names in the data structures were 2-8b wider.<p>I get it.  I&#x27;m an engineer too.  Engineers love this sort of thing.  It&#x27;s also intrinsically part of the process that makes things better and brings new ideas to the table.  But on a personal level, I can&#x27;t handle the tedium anymore.  It&#x27;s not them, it&#x27;s me.<p>Where do I go from here?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
