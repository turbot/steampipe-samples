It seems to me that some of the issues we had with tech never really got resolved. Instead, new tech got more popular to the point that we sorta forgot about the old problems.<p>Examples:<p>- Apple refusing to let people share files using BlueTooth on iOS devices was a big headache for many users. To the point that some would jailbreak their phone to activate this feature. But after AirDrop, there was less motivation to do so. It doesn&#x27;t mean that Apple conceded because they still don&#x27;t allow BlueTooth file sharing. But with AirDrop, cloud, and streaming services, there&#x27;s really not that much of a need to share files like the old days anymore.<p>- Apple not allowing people to install macOS (then OS X) on any device other than Macs. There were many workarounds to this and people tried Hackintosh for so many years, but with so much stuff going on in the tech world these days, which operating system you use has less of a significance.<p>- Apple dropping support for HiDPI (and scaling) that resulted in many 2K monitors not working properly. This happened in the past two years and we sorta accepted it because many of us use 4K monitors anyway.<p>The list goes on. In such cases, the old problem never gets solved, but is overshadowed by the new tech (which will then cause its own problems!)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
