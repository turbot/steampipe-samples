I wondered if I could bring that power to Slack over a short time frame. Of course, the functionality is limited being a single developer for two days. But here is what it currently supports:<p><pre><code>  - Getting a one-off response from GPTBot when mentioning the bot (@GPTBot) in a channel you are both a member of.
  - Exchanging a full conversation with context carried over. To start a full conversation, run the command: `&#x2F;gptbot start`. To end the conversation, run the command: `&#x2F;gptbot stop`.
  - Using the latest GPT-4 model. If you want to start a conversation with the new GPT-4 model, run the command `&#x2F;gptbot start gpt-4`. In this mode, responses take a longer time. By default, the model used is gpt-3.5-turbo.
  - Collaboration eg: add the Bot to a channel, start a conversation with it (`&#x2F;gptbot start`): every channel members can reply to the Bot to help refine the answers it provides.
</code></pre>
