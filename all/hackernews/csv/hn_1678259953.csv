 I Don’t want to become captured by the “I’m special” thing, it’s a like a warm blanket.<p>But evidence and expert opinions has gotten harder to reason out of, self hatred and hopelessness is mounting, repeatedly losing short term relationships and potential friends without any clear mistake made.<p>Being very good looking, I believe people seem to often overlook deficits for a month or two ( or 2 hours) then often disappear without explanation. 
I can sometimes suppress some of my more odd emotionally unaware behaviors for a short period. Usually When drunk I can pick up some cues and display the expected reaction emotions but I don’t really feel them enough for them to be involuntary.<p>I am instinctually repulsed by the flimsy nature of DSM. 
Anyone benefit functionally from accepting a “label”, even if you told no one after?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
