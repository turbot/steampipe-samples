When I was in college, I learned the C programming language, VB.NET, and C# and my approach to programming always was clear to me (my train of thought).<p>Back to my present situation, I found a job as a junior web developer around 6 months ago, where I have been able to get the rust off my dormant programming skills, but the programming approaches and technologies they use are around 20 years old. I really want to get experience to later on get a job with modern technologies. I&#x27;ve been reading about Typescript, node.js and Angular.<p>For those with experience on the field, which of these (or other) technologies would you recommend learning for someone like me? Would there be a particular order? Thanks in advance.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
