My wife and I have ran a software consultancy for 8 years, and we found that after sales and staff - our biggest challenge was capturing requirements, confirming requirements, and having a standard way for everyone to access the source of truth (both clients and staff).<p>We found important info was being kept solely on a JIRA ticket, and completely disappeared when the ticked moved to &quot;Done&quot;.<p>Requirements were being confirmed in many places. E.g. verbally, in emails, in project management tools, etc. This led to miscommunication and a lack of traceability.<p>And although I had always believed in working software over comprehensive documentation - I found with larger projects and complex business rules, keeping the functionality in your head was a full-time job.<p>So we&#x27;ve built Userdoc - a requirements management system to gather, collaborate on, and confirm your software project requirements.<p>An opinionated requirements management system, leveraging standard agile concepts (user stories, user personas, and user journeys) to build a knowledge base for your software project.<p>There&#x27;s a video demo on the website which runs through the core functionality.<p>Would love to hear your feedback, and more than happy to answer any questions.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;userdoc.fyi"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;userdoc.fyi</a>",story,https://userdoc.fyi,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
