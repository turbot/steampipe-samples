Since some fans can&#x27;t listen to the show when it&#x27;s live (work hours), a few people have been relying on me sharing the archives. I&#x27;m hosting all the episodes on multiple free plans of Mega.nz to have them available to share and I have a Wordpress blog setup to autopost links to new episodes from my VPS with a very basic bash program.<p>This setup is very stable (it has been on autopilot for the last couple years except minor fixes) but now I would like to remake it with more features.
Since Whisper was released I&#x27;ve been very interested in trying to feed the whole archive (2000+ 2hrs episodes) into it and get a searchable transcript, so people could just search a name or a phrase and find out all the episodes where it was mentioned.<p>I recently watched the full CS50 course on YT and at the moment I&#x27;m undecided about which language to choose to create what I have in mind. So far I only studied c# in school, and python&#x2F;html&#x2F;css on my own.
The website would have to list the episodes in some way from an SQL db, have it searchable by date (every episode name is the date it was aired), and ideally also have a search field for &quot;text&quot; that appears the transcript, which is still a work in progress.<p>What framework&#x2F;language would you recommend?
Is there a similar project you&#x27;ve done where I could take inspiration?<p>If you want you can contact me via the email in my profile, thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Their work is to get things done, then leave them to the engineer team to figure out. The problem has been raised many times, but no solutions so far.<p>More context about the teams: The R&amp;D team is located in California, while the engineering team (including me) is located in Hanoi.
