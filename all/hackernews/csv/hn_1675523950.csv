It&#x27;s a negative at companies lauding a free-for-all hybrid policy, no set days&#x2F;week when employees should be in the office, leading them to often come in when it&#x27;s dead and mostly defeating the point.<p>2.

34654771,Ask HN: Why Java ecosystem doesn't feel as vibrant as some other lang's ecosys?,2023-02-04T14:34:18Z,rrishi,1,false,false,1,[34654814],,,,"Based on my experience, other languages are a lot more in news<p>1. There&#x27;s constantly new frameworks, meta-frameworks, new language features being developed in the JS ecosystem. Some do criticize the churn in JS ecosystem (JS fatigue), but on the positive side it keeps the community active . Conversations around SSR, hydration strategies, reactive programming, functional programming, transpilers keeps the creative juices flowing. On the other hand, Java developers feel stuck on Spring.<p>2. Python may have lucked out here but pretty much most of the &quot;hot&quot; fields such as AI, ML and data science use Python. Also, Django brings its own die hard fans. If we ever do get to AGI, it will be written in Python. Java doesn&#x27;t have the allure of having a &quot;hot&quot; field (except maybe big data tools). Neither Java nor any of its libs have  have die hard fans or thier voices get drowned in a sea of die hard haters of Java.<p>3. Lisp and ML languages get praises in their niche ecosystems and have a lot of people that are absolutely in love with the features and the mindsets of those languages<p>4. C&#x2F;C++ devs have a shiny new toy in Rust and for good reason too.<p>Unfortunately, Java just doesn&#x27;t get the spotlight as much as all these langs. Is there a future for Java when the dev community is giving it such a cold shoulder?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

There have been some great tutorials on how you can do this and we thought we&#x27;d share our approach with the community as we believe it&#x27;s very accessible.<p>Under the hood, it&#x27;s using vector search to extract relevant content from the dataset and then using that to feed it into GPT. The post features a video where you can see it in action answering specific questions about the Relevance AI platform. This technique is great as it avoids costly fine-tuning and works around the token length limits.<p>You can get started without code by uploading a CSV, vectorising the data and using Ask Relevance from the dashboard. If you&#x27;d like to then integrate it into your docs&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;anywhere else you can grab the API request - which automatically generates the vector for the input query, retrieves the top N results and passes it over to GPT before returning the response.<p>This is all powered by our platform which enables running AI workflows, at-scale on any data without code and managing your own infrastructure.",story,https://relevanceai.com/blog/use-all-of-your-blog-posts-and-docs-as-context-for-chatgpt-style-questions-and-answers,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
