34064273,I created 3 months' worth of SEO-friendly blog posts in 2 days using GPT-3,2022-12-20T11:04:01Z,milanspeaks,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I started a small productized SaaS business called growby.net. I am manually reaching out to potential companies to bring customers for growby and wanted to start SEO to boost some traffic. This is the process I follow. I am just sharing here to discuss the pros and cons of this approach.<p>Day 1:<p>1: Competitor Analysis:
The first thing I did was to identify a competitor which is already ranking for the keywords I want to rank. I identified one website that was getting monthly traffic of 50k using search. I wanted to rank better for most of the keywords they are ranking.<p>2: Ahrefs Crawling of competitor&#x27;s website:
I did a scan of the competitor&#x27;s website using Ahref&#x27;s tool. Ahref gave me a list of around 45 blog post URL that was ranking nicely for them. Ahref also gave me a list of a total of 12000 keywords for all URLs combined. I exported all the data from Ahref in an Excel File. I aimed to finish 12 articles from this list of 45 in the next 2 days.<p>The above activity was to be done once only. now we will work on activities that have to be repetitive.<p>3: Keyword Clustering - GPT3 Entry :-) :
I applied a filter on the URL and started working on the first blog post. The first article was about &quot;Performance Appraisal in HR&quot; and the competitor was ranking for almost 2500 keywords for it. I asked ChatGPT to do a clustering for all these 2500 keywords and I found a list of 10-12 important keywords. These are the keywords I want to target for creating the blog post.<p>4: Preparing Outline of the blog post - SEO META in 1 CLICK tool:<p>I opened the competitor&#x27;s blog with the &quot;Performance Appraisal in HR&quot; related article and exported all the h1, and h2 tags using the &quot;SEO META in 1 CLICK&quot; plugin. I now got the article outline and the keywords for this page.<p>5: Actual Blog-Post creation using GPT3:<p>I just prompted the outline, and keywords in GPT3 to make a decent introduction, blogpost, conclusion, and key takeaways. It&#x27;s important to ensure that the prompts are much more detailed to not get a generic reply.<p>6: Publish the blog post:<p>I published the blog post on my WordPress blog website. My blog post with almost 1500 words was ready with full research in just one day. A lot of time was spent in researching and identifying tools and preparing proper prompts for GPT3. I knew that the second day was going to be simple.<p>Day 2:<p>7: Publish the remaining 11 blog posts:<p>I just repeated steps number 3 to 6 for the next article and I was ready with it in the next 30 mins. I kept on creating till all 12 blog posts are created. I published them and did all the necessary design and usability changes. Each blog post is above 1000 words.<p>8: Update Sitemap and Search Console submission:<p>I used a free online crawling SEO tool to generate a sitemap and updated it on the website and the Google Search console. I did internal backlinking of all these blog-post to make them look proper.<p>9: Google Crawl and Indexing:
Google has now started crawling and indexing these pages. I now need to create a list of backlinks and work on the technical SEO part.<p>10: Conclusion:<p>Each of the 12 blog posts I created is above 1000 words and I would have taken at least a week to write each blog post because of the research part and drifting away to Twitter, IH, etc. The 12 blog post would have taken me at least 12 weeks for sure.<p>I am yet to see any traffic&#x2F;impression increase because of this work and so I have not resumed work for the remaining articles. I will have to work a lot on the suggestions provided by Ahref to increase the domain authority. I feel that if I stay consistent with this process, there is a probability to generate good traffic via SEO.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
