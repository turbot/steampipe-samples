34970710,Show HN: Vizard – AI video editor repurpose long video to bite-size highlights,2023-02-28T15:57:59Z,garyzhang,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello, Hacker News community! I’m Gary, the founder of Vizard.ai. I am thrilled to introduce you to our cutting-edge AI video editing tool that is designed to help content creators&#x2F;marketers&#x2F;businesses alike to repurpose long-form webinar&#x2F;event&#x2F;speech videos into bite-size social-ready highlights.<p>As a beginner in video editing, I struggled with the complexity of professional video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Apple Final Cut Pro. I found it overwhelming and challenging to use, and I would eventually abandon my efforts to edit videos. But I knew that video content creation was important, and I was determined to find a solution.<p>Being an expert in AI, I decided to use my knowledge to simplify video editing. That&#x27;s when I came up with the idea for Vizard.ai.<p>I have trained several deep learning models that work together to simplify the video editing process. The first model is a computer vision model that segments the video into pieces. The second model is a speech-to-text model that transcribes the voice in the video. The last model is a scene change detector model that detects changes in the video.<p>When I combined these three models, I was able to edit the video like editing a picture. I could trim the video by transcript text, making the process much simpler and more intuitive.<p>Our tool is intuitive, easy to use, and designed to simplify the video editing process for beginners. With Vizard.ai, content creators, marketers, and businesses can quickly and efficiently repurpose long-form video content into bite-size social-ready highlights, increasing their reach and engagement on social media.<p>I am excited to share my story and the story of Vizard.ai with the Hacker News community. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your feedback and questions.",story,https://vizard.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Just spent 2 meetings w&#x2F; a company that needs proprietary technology from my ($20k MRR) startup to raise their own Series A.<p>2. Their CEO and I have a similar background: we both geeked out on the same scientific breakthrough a few years ago and each figured out a real-world application of it.<p>3. I just launched an AI-augmented software implementation that I sell to SMBs as a SaaS subscription. This guy went with a hardware implementation (a steampunk machine that he travels around with) that he sells as a service to Fortune-500-level companies.<p>4. These guys launched ~5 years ago, are badasses and make a killing, w&#x2F; $4MM+ a year in revenue and great profits.<p>5. They want to raise a $5MM Series A to turn their service offering into a digital, subscription-based, pay-$$-per-user-per-month offer to their existing Enterprise clients.<p>6. All their Enterprise clients say &quot;we want to put 10,000 users in at $6&#x2F;month&#x2F;user, BUT we would need features [X] and [Y] before we sign on&quot;.
Their projection is an opportunity of ~20MM in ARR in 5 years. However this company can&#x27;t deliver either X or Y with their current hardware stack.<p>7. They&#x27;re trying to raise the Series A to build a software stack that delivers X and Y (they&#x27;re budgeting 2 years and $1.5MM+ out of their raise to get there). VCs are saying that the technical risk is way too big, so they&#x27;ve turned to private investors.<p>8. Their CEO&#x2F;co-founder just found out that we have already built &quot;X&quot;, and that with our tech base we can build &quot;Y&quot; super easily. He&#x27;s thrilled because partnering with us would completely de-risk their big strategic move.<p>9. On our side, &quot;Y&quot; is a feature that our SMB customers don&#x27;t need, so we have to be very careful and strategic about going that direction since it might divert us from building feature Z that our core market desires, and which is on our direct path to product-market fit.<p>Where do I go from here?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
