It makes it easy for developers to control how their product behaves for customers in different pricing tiers. So things like which features are enabled for whom, rate limits and seat limits, but also your customer secrets (with end-to-end encryption), and other configurations.<p>After 15 years of working together at various companies, where we rebuilt the same SaaS foundation layer again and again - we wanted to create something reliable and feature-rich that will be available for everyone. 
We now have a backoffice UI, a backend and SDKs for managing customer features and a way to manage pricing tiers on top of it. We plan to add more features around metering and integration with Stripe, so that ideally Enrolla can be used to bootstrap any new SaaS software in minutes.<p>We’ve launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use it. The goal is not to charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for enterprise features like Salesforce&#x2F;Hubspot and SSO integrations.<p>Give it a try (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enrolla&#x2F;enrolla"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enrolla&#x2F;enrolla</a>), and let us know what you think!<p>Main website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enrolla.io"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enrolla.io</a>",story,https://www.enrolla.io,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This is crypto library for C++ 20 that I develop in my free time.
My goals are to support compile-time evaluation, provide clean interfaces and runtime performance (some assembly modules for x86_64 are available). 
Major compilers are supported. Be careful with msvc, build parallelization combined with constexpr loves ram for some of constexpr tests.
This pic speaks for itself, seems kinda funny:

Not an issue with other supported compilers.

The members of both houses were gathered to hear his 2022 State of the Union Address. The atmosphere was tense, as the country had undergone significant changes in the past year.<p>&quot;My fellow Americans,&quot; President Biden began, his voice steady and confident. &quot;We have faced many challenges in the past year, but we have also made great strides towards a better future.&quot;<p>There was a smattering of applause, but mostly silence as the members of Congress listened intently.<p>&quot;We have taken steps to address the ongoing pandemic, to restore our economy, and to rebuild our communities,&quot; the President continued. &quot;But there is still much work to be done.&quot;<p>There was a pause, as the President looked out over the sea of faces before him.<p>&quot;We must continue to work together, to find common ground, and to build a brighter future for all Americans,&quot; he said, his voice growing stronger. &quot;And that starts with each and every one of us, taking responsibility for our actions, and working towards a better tomorrow.&quot;<p>There was a loud round of applause, and the President smiled, his eyes shining with determination.<p>&quot;Together, we can, and we will, build a better future for all Americans,&quot; he declared, before leaving the podium and returning to the White House, ready to continue the work of making America great again.<p>prompt: continue<p>The members of Congress slowly began to filter out of the chambers, deep in thought and conversation about the President&#x27;s address. Some were inspired by his words, while others were more skeptical, but all agreed that there was much work to be done in the coming year.<p>As they made their way back to their offices, they were approached by a group of reporters, eager for their reactions to the State of the Union Address.<p>&quot;Senator, what did you think of the President&#x27;s speech?&quot; one reporter asked, shoving a microphone in the face of a elderly Senator from Ohio.<p>The Senator hesitated for a moment, before responding. &quot;Well, I think the President is certainly on the right track. There is no denying that we have faced some significant challenges in the past year, but I believe that, with the right leadership and the right policies, we can turn things around.&quot;<p>Another reporter turned to a young Congressman from California, who was known for his progressive views. &quot;Congressman, you&#x27;ve been critical of the President&#x27;s policies in the past. What do you think of his address tonight?&quot;<p>The Congressman nodded, his face serious. &quot;I appreciate the President&#x27;s words, but I&#x27;m afraid they fall short of what we actually need. We need real action, not just empty promises, if we&#x27;re going to turn this country around.&quot;<p>The reporters continued to pepper the members of Congress with questions, each offering their own unique perspective on the President&#x27;s speech. But as the night wore on, it became clear that, regardless of their political views, they were all united in their determination to work towards a better future for the country they loved.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
