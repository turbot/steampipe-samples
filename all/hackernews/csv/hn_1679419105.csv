It occurred to me that it would be fun to build such a tool, and as the ultimate act of dogfooding, try to build it with GPT!<p>So PAIR is the starting point here. You can see a recent commit message has a log of my interactions with the model that produced that commit.<p>Next step is to add better mechanisms to manage the model input context (e.g. make it easy for the model to see the latest version of a source file when needed) followed by mechanisms for allowing the model to suggest changes via diffs that are quickly reviewed and accepted by the human in the loop before being applied to the file and tested.<p>I would love to hear from others who have experimented with GPT pair programming in a chat-style interface and any feedback you might have on your experience with it.",story,https://github.com/jiggy-ai/pair,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Finally, we summarize such aggregated context using the power of GPT.<p>As devs we know that it&#x27;s very annoying to look at a new codebase and start understanding all the nuances, particularly when the person who wrote the code already left the company.
