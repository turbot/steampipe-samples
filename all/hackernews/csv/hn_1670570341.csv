I appreciate that Go is a lightweight language which doesn&#x27;t require a full blown IDE to write code, but that&#x27;s about it. Performance-wise [0], library-wise, it looks like Kotlin &#x2F; Java &#x2F; .NET would provide much more productive and entreprise-level tools. Writing Go code wasn&#x27;t even that enjoyable, it felt like I was reinventing the wheel for many things with a language that is not very expressive (no algebraic types, no ternary, no optional arguments etc.)<p>If you were to write backend code for a startup or anything bigger than a sideproject, but not for system programming &#x2F; infrastructure stuff, is there a case to be made to use Go over Kotlin &#x2F; Java &#x2F; .NET ? Is Go used in any large-scale business applications projects ?<p>In general, this made me wonder what kind of use cases exactly is Go targeting? For business logic, the Java &#x2F; .NET ecosystem seems more mature, for system programming and low-level stuff, Rust is safer and more powerful<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techempower.com&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;#section=data-r21&amp;test=composite",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
