34789241,Show HN: I built an AI that drafts emails based on 'inbox memory',2023-02-14T13:53:40Z,penguinten,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey everyone,<p>I spent the last few weeks building Warmest.ai.<p>Warmest is an AI email assistant that writes emails in the background for you, in your tone of voice, and with your content.<p>Every time you open your inbox, Warmest will have already written a draft response to all your emails. It&#x27;s a bit like having a Chief of Staff or a PA.<p>When you first connect, Warmest indexes your inbox and creates vector embeddings out of all the emails you&#x27;ve sent, creating an &#x27;inbox memory&#x27;. It then does vector search on this &#x27;memory&#x27; to find similar emails, so that content you have previously sent can be pulled into a draft.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say someone emails you the question &quot;What is the value proposition of your business?&quot;. If you have answered that in an email before, Warmest will prepare a draft with with a your company value prop already populated. This massively reduces the amount of time you need to spend on repetitive emails, and helps you get through your inbox faster.<p>Warmest works super well for anything where you&#x27;ve needed to write an email more than once. Things like B2B sales, scheduling, customer support, or FAQs.<p>It&#x27;s still in beta, but please give it a spin, and would really love any feedback!",story,https://www.warmest.ai,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Veracrypt also appears to be secure most importantly it does not appear to have backdoors as its source code is opensource. However, there are virtually no high-profile cases where a government or police entity has admitted to not being able to break their encryption.<p>What do you think?
