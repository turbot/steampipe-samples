Recently a startup reached out to me about a Technical Content Marketer (TCM) role - it seems a little interesting and somewhat of a hybrid between technical writing and interfacing with other devs.<p>I&#x27;m &quot;curious&quot; about the role and think it could be an interesting change of pace but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d seek out myself normally. Ultimately, if&#x2F;when I ever switch out of a &quot;purely technical position&quot; it would be with the goal of moving towards an Eng. Leadership&#x2F;Director type role. It seems moving from a TCM position to Dev. Advocate position could make sense but am just spitballing here.<p>Has anyone worked with&#x2F;as&#x2F;for TCMs in the past?
