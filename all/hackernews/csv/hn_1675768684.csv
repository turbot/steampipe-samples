34691214,Ask HN: Best free/OS software for network/hardware monitoring?,2023-02-07T11:01:54Z,BitShuffler,1,false,false,,,,,,"Im increasingly taking over parts of our company network, hardware and planning from our &quot;soon&quot; (5yrs) to be retired admin.. 
as I do take closer looks behind the curtains.. I need more control.. which is why I started to look into monitoring solutions.<p>Im a big fan of open source software (and hardware), so naturally I looked into those first, but there is simply too many opinions on the general internet.<p>my first choice as of now would be  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nemslinux.com&#x2F; or the 2nd would be https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.librenms.org<p>I need to get my hands onto anything, so at this point it doesnt really matter.<p>What does HN recommend? Are the OS tools sufficient? Id like to monitor as much as possible, then have a centralized server storing those infos, with alters and triggers and such.<p>Of course we do have security (Sophos UTM) but I feel like I could do much much more with small little errors in Windows, configs... and of course security with detailed logs and monitoring, simply to see early and maybe even prevent the worst damage.<p>Or should I take an entirely different approach to further securing the network and getting hints if problems occour? What would HN admins do?<p>thanks in advance!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
