Conventional architecture is a “don’t ask, don’t tell” architecture in which data is collected only when requested. Suppose there are three services in issue, A, B, and C. Service A asks the other services, “What is your present state?” and assumes they are always ready to respond. This puts the user in a position if the other services are unavailable.<p>Retries are utilized by microservices as a workaround to compensate for network failures or any negative impacts brought on by changes in the network topology. However, this ultimately adds another layer of complexity and increases the expense.<p>In order to address the problems with the conventional design, event-driven architecture adopts a “tell, don’t ask” philosophy. In the example above, Services B and C publish Continuous Streams of data, such as Events, and Service A subscribes to these Event Streams. Then, Service A may evaluate the facts, aggregate the outcomes, and locally cache them.<p>Utilizing Event Streams in this manner has various advantages, including:<p>-Systems are capable of closely imitating actual processes.
-Increased usage of scale-to-zero functions (serverless computing) as more services are able to stay idle until required.
-Enhanced adaptability",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
