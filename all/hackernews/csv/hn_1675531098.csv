The reaction I expect is: &quot;This is a solved problem, we don&#x27;t need a new website builder, there&#x27;s already too many of them!&quot;<p>And though it&#x27;s true, with yawb.io I attempt to solve some pain points that are really anoying with other platforms:<p>1. It&#x27;s expandable: So in yawb.io everything is a block; Drag &amp; Drop (the regular stuff nowadays). What makes it powerful is that you can create your own blocks, with your own funcitonalities. You can download blocks, share them, upload them...
I&#x27;ve made some documentation to help people get started building their own blocks: 
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yawb-io&#x2F;sample-block"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yawb-io&#x2F;sample-block</a><p>2. You can export your website: One click allows you to download a zip file of your whole website, HTML, CSS, JS and image assets. Host it on your own infrastructure if that&#x27;s what you need.<p>3. It&#x27;s inexpensive: Hosting a simple website for a restaurant or a portfolio website shouldn&#x27;t cost 23$&#x2F;month for the base plan. Platforms like Squarespace spend millions on sponsoring YouTube videos and getting celebrity endorsements, which results into the high monthly subscription.
With yawb.io, there&#x27;s an always Free plan and if you want to go with the premium plan, it&#x27;s only 5$&#x2F;month.<p>4. It&#x27;s highly customizable: For real, you can select any element in the page and have access to a whole range of styling properties: Font, Colors, Spacing, Effects...<p>And those are the main reasons why I decided to build this platform. I want web designers to be confident that they will have all the design freedom they need to build unique websites without breaking the bank.<p>The platform is currently in beta, so if you want to give it a try, you can use the invite Code: HACKERNEWS",story,https://app.yawb.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
