34929968,Show HN: Sail a historical full-rigged ship in real global weather,2023-02-24T20:52:14Z,Lefuz,2,false,false,,,,,,"This is a simulator of a frigate from about 1800. It has realistic physics, tuned to match historical performance. The UI is based around commands given in period naval language. Rather than use the current weather, it has a full year&#x27;s weather data (for 1980 - taken from <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psl.noaa.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;gridded&#x2F;data.ncep.reanalysis2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psl.noaa.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;gridded&#x2F;data.ncep.reanalysis2.html</a>). This allows the weather to change realistically under time acceleration.<p>To learn the basics of handling a square-rigged ship, start the &quot;Harbour&quot; scenario, click on the instructions button at the bottom left, and follow the instructions to try to get out of Portsmouth harbour.<p>To go for a long sail, start the &quot;The World&quot; scenario. Open the map, control+click anywhere on it to move there; control+click on the compass at the bottom left to turn the ship to that heading; then activate travel acceleration at the bottom right.<p>It&#x27;s a simulator more than a game - think MS flight simulator. There&#x27;s no sinking, but you can lose sails or spars in high winds. It&#x27;s windows only.<p>This was released a couple of years ago, but this is an updated version from the end of January. See the devlog (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thapen.itch.io&#x2F;painted-ocean&#x2F;devlog"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thapen.itch.io&#x2F;painted-ocean&#x2F;devlog</a>) for the changes.

34930083,Show HN: Atlantis workflow without a backend,2023-02-24T21:02:34Z,ujnproduct,1,false,false,,,,,,"Last week we created a TF cloud alternative that could just run in GH actions and got an overwhelming response on Reddit. A lot of people recommended Atlantis as a way to run terraform plan and apply jobs in your CI. It is used by many great teams (Lyft for example) - however, we see the following issues:<p>- You need to deploy and maintain an Atlantis backend in your infrastructure<p>- It runs terraform commands locally on the same server it is installed in. This makes it tricky to achieve high levels of isolation and repeatability that is typically needed in CI&#x2F;CD scenarios<p>So we thought: does this really need a backend? Can we somehow make it work without a need to deploy a dedicated service and with terraform jobs running natively in Github Actions with proper isolation?
Actually, the only need that makes Atlantis backend irreplaceable is code-level locks (not to be confused with state locks). But these can be stored in a database, accessed directly from the action - it can even be the same DB that is used by Terraform for state locks!<p>So we’ve built a proof-of-concept that does just that: it stores higher-level locks in DynamoDB, so there’s no need for any backend. It works like this :<p>- create a PR - this will create a lock<p>- comment digger plan - terraform plan output will be added as comment<p>- create another PR - plan or apply won’t work in this PR until the first lock is released<p>- you will get  Locked by PR #1
 comment<p>This proof-of-concept is very much a WIP - for example, there’s no support for apply and then there are things like one PR applied making plans from other PRs thinking new resources need to be deleted; so you need to merge main before re-running plan - and other things like that.<p>Would love to hear what the HN community thinks!",story,https://github.com/diggerhq/tfrun,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
