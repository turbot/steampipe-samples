34689516,Ask HN: Insurance Agent Fraud?,2023-02-07T06:39:14Z,voakbasda,1,false,false,1,[34689657],,,,"My insurance agent recently made a mistake while fulfilling a request from a lender.  In short, she added coverage to my home&#x2F;farm policy for a piece of equipment that I already had on my auto policy, thinking it was a new identical piece of equipment.  This effectively revealed that I have been paying five or six times more than was necessary to have the coverage required by said lender.<p>Upon reflection of this situation, I realized that a dishonest agent could easily steer clients into this kind of situation on purpose.  Not sure whether she is on commission, but that would be sufficient motive.<p>Between Hanlon and Occam’s razors, I want to believe it was an honest mistake, but I wanted to hear the opinions and stories from this crowd.
