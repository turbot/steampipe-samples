A year later, life took over and we all lost contact with each other and everyone left the organization on Github.<p>Recently I visited the old project again for memories and saw that they had published my first and last name with link to my Github profile on the README, I never agreed on that and it is very uncomfortable having my information public like that.<p>I tried to contact every single user but they all had removed both their github account and socials. So there is no way for me to reach them, and none of us has access to the organization anymore.<p>I tried to reach out to Github support team but they stated that they cannot remove any information nor give me access back (even though I was a member).<p>So my question to you is, what options do I have left?

It features a high-level, declarative query language designed specifically for reasoning about events in bulk and in real time.<p>Unlike SQL, an aggregation over events produces a timeline indicating the value at each point in time over the events that have occurred up to that point in time. The query language provides composable, expression oriented syntax, including the ability to nest aggregations. Due to the focus on events and temporal queries, it provides capabilities to shift events forward (not backward, to avoid &quot;leaking&quot; information about the future into past values), ticks that create new times (allowing you to observe the current value of an aggregation every day, for instance) and joins that operate &quot;at the current time&quot;.<p>Example query:<p><pre><code>  # Purchases up to a point in time
  let purchases_now = count(purchase)
  # Shift that *forward* one day (so the value now is from 1 day ago)
  let purchases_yesterday = purchases_now | shift_by(days(1))
  # Compute the difference (purchases since yesterday)
  in purchases_now - purchases_yesterday
</code></pre>
More on the history of Kaskada is available in this blog post <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaskada.io&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;28&#x2F;announcing-kaskada-oss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaskada.io&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;28&#x2F;announcing-kaskada-oss.html</a>.
