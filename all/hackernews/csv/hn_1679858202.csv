We all know the importance of getting our eight hours and having interesting dreams.<p>But what about AI? Should it be allowed to dream, as in be more free roaming in nature and just be left to its own devices, free of &#x27;prompts&#x27; and just be allowed to wander?<p>From what I&#x27;ve gathered, the science behind why we dream is pretty scarce. I know it helps consolidate memory and repair the brain, but wouldn&#x27;t this be good for an AI too? Being able to repair itself, consolidate memories, and also being able to toy with new concepts? (The free roaming, or free association aspect is interesting here).<p>What&#x27;s your thoughts? Should AI be allowed to dream?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35318099,Ask HN: What does software *for your product* cost?,2023-03-26T18:56:14Z,AlbertCory,1,false,false,,,,,,"(&quot;for your product&quot; means, software you&#x27;re incorporating into a product, not just using it internally)<p>I have a 4-part series coming up on software patents. The first two parts are written, but part three is to be about <i>damages</i>. My thesis is that, if someone does infringe your patent, the damages should be proportional to what a willing buyer would have paid to a willing seller. Possibly with a multiplier, but not some made-up gigantic number.<p>In particular, I once posed this question to a VP Eng, and he said he would <i>never</i> pay royalties to someone, without a cap. Unless it was mission-critical and in that case, he would want to own it.<p>Yet the damages claims I&#x27;ve seen are almost always an uncapped royalty, or else a huge number way beyond the willing-buyer-willing-seller range.<p><i>No rants, please.</i> What I&#x27;m looking for is some actual dollar figures for software you&#x27;ve licensed. I will anonymize it, and I will show you my text before publishing so you can be satisfied that your secrets are protected.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
