35242069,OpenAI to discontinue support for the Codex API,2023-03-21T03:03:13Z,thejosh,2,false,false,1,[35242123],,,,"Just received this email, can&#x27;t find a blog post yet?<p>On March 23rd, we will discontinue support for the Codex API. All customers will have to transition to a different model. Codex was initially introduced as a free limited beta in 2021, and has maintained that status to date. Given the advancements of our newest GPT-3.5 models for coding tasks, we will no longer be supporting Codex and encourage all customers to transition to GPT-3.5-Turbo.
About GPT-3.5-Turbo
GPT-3.5-Turbo is the most cost effective and performant model in the GPT-3.5 family. It can both do coding tasks while also being complemented with flexible natural language capabilities.<p>You can learn more through:
