So..is the phone number itself subject to the privacy laws and or privacy statements of websites? 
Usage would be when you add it to a website for 2FA for instance. Is the website entitled to use it as an identifier?
Because it is almost unique it could be used for tracking purposes. It is a unique identifier to you. 
I am not talking about phone calls, but because it can be associated with your interactions on a website it can be used as data and collated (by Google or Facebook etc).
It can be cross referenced with other websites.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

their webisite only had &quot;sign in with google&quot; so i didnt bother. The day before i check the website out of boredom and saw &quot;sign in with github&quot;. i logged in, clicked through a bunch of pages because its the same drill everytime. 
i found out that i had &quot;automatically starred their repos&quot;. by the looks of it, around 500 &quot;stars&quot;, the last i saw.<p>suddenly i am unable to log in to my github and the page just says &quot;account suspended.&quot;<p>contacted their support and the last response i got from them was &quot;your ban should stay as you engaged in improper behavior of stars farming&quot; or some other BS.<p>Here is my problem.
