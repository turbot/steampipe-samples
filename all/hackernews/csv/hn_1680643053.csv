For years now, I&#x27;ve struggled with a lack of ambition and drive. I&#x27;ve tried building startups in the past, but I fell into debt and had some negative experiences that left me feeling deflated.<p>Nowadays, I spend most of my days at home smoking weed and playing video games, while working part-time as a software engineer. I know this isn&#x27;t a sustainable or fulfilling lifestyle, but I just can&#x27;t seem to find the motivation to do anything else.<p>I feel like something inside me is not alive, and I&#x27;m struggling to figure out what it is. I want to change, but I don&#x27;t know how. Has anyone here experienced something similar? Do you have any advice on how I can overcome this lack of drive and ambition?<p>I appreciate any insights or feedback you might have.
