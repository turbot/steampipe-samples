I just released go-nbd, a lightweight Go library for effortlessly creating NBD servers and clients with Go. Its a neat tool for creating custom Linux block devices with arbitrary backends, such as a file, byte slice or what I&#x27;m planning to use it for, a tape drive. While there are a few partially abandoned projects like this out there already, this library tries to be as maintainable as possible by only implementing the most recent handshake revision and baseline functionality for both the client and the server, while still having enough support to be useful.<p>I&#x27;d love to get your feedback :)",story,https://github.com/pojntfx/go-nbd,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Like they work, but then fail slowly, or reboot and are quick and the GUI is snappy...then the next morning a device on the network can&#x27;t talk to another device on the network.<p>So what do you use to conclusively say: This thing is broken, I can dispose of it without any niggling concerns that I&#x27;m just a firmware update away from fixing it?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
