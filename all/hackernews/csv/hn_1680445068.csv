When a concept is referred to in its plural form, it takes on a much more abstract image when I try to visualize it in my mind, which for me is more difficult to work with. On the other hand, a concept referred to as a singular instance (&quot;An XYZ is ...&quot;) collapses down into a single unit, which <i>I think</i> is easier for me to mentally visualize.<p>I guess in a sense, a plural form concept is to a wall as a singular instance of a concept is to a brick (or at least that&#x27;s how I imagine it might feel to a learner).<p>What do you guys think about this, and are there any pedagogy studies about this?

I&#x27;m not an expert in ML but I&#x27;ve studied a lot recently and my understanding is:
- I can&#x27;t use the AUTOMATIC1111 api because it doesn&#x27;t support multiple requests
- Generally, one GPU will only serve one request, so I shouldn&#x27;t use a cloud GPU server and build my own API
- Serverless is the way to go then, but cold starts are a problem and it takes a long time to run a model<p>Also I want to note that I know there&#x27;s some services that run SD out of the box as API, but I&#x27;m not interested in them as I need to make specific changes to my model.<p>My current best attempt is banana.dev, I have pushed my model as cog adapted to Docker, but it is quite slow and the service seems to under a lot of stress lately, sometimes taking 1+ min even to return an initial response (not with the generated image, just a response to say that it started the job)<p>Another option is replicate.com but it&#x27;s quite expensive and slow too.<p>Are those the best current options or can I do something better, with more work on my side? 
I have found stochastic.ai and modals.com but would like some opinions before I start building adapter for these services.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
