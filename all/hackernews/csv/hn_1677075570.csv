By analogy, a killer library is a library so good it justifies using a specific programming language. Two examples:<p>* Ruby on Rails was so good for webdev at the time it justified using Ruby.<p>* Pandas is so good for datascience it justifies using Python.<p>Usually there are alternatives to the killer library in other languages, but they don’t catch on for one reason or another— usability, lack of critical features, etc. This can change over time. Arguably quickcheck could have been a killer library for Haskell, but now most languages have a decent PBT framework.<p>What are some killer libraries for your language of choice?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Look no further than Puke 2 Earn, the revolutionary NFT collection featuring puking apes that offers a multitude of benefits.<p>First and foremost, Puke 2 Earn allows you to get your hands on an incredibly cool NFT on Ethereum, the largest NFT marketplace for buying and selling. But that&#x27;s not all - you also have the opportunity to claim the same NFT on the brand new Sui blockchain, which boasts breakthrough technologies and a dedicated team and investors.<p>But the true game-changer is the Puke 2 Earn play-to-earn game, which will be launched on the Sui blockchain. As a NFT holder, you will have access to this one-of-a-kind game that allows you to play and earn using revolutionary cashflow mechanics.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget about the rarity factor. The Puke 2 Earn collection contains 10,000 unique NFTs, with a select few having rare traits. Plus, the first mint will be on the Ethereum blockchain, providing even more opportunities for holders.<p>But don&#x27;t just take our word for it - the recent test mint of 1,000 Puke 2 Earn NFTs on the BlueMove marketplace caused such a frenzy that it temporarily collapsed the Sui blockchain. Demand for these NFTs was through the roof, and they quickly became the most popular collection on the BlueMove marketplace with over 31,000 likes.<p>Holders of the test Puke 2 Earn NFTs also received White Lists for buying NFTs on Ethereum and had the chance to participate in WL giveaways on the Puke 2 Earn Twitter page.<p>The bottom line is that demand for Puke 2 Earn NFTs exceeds supply, so don&#x27;t miss out on this opportunity to own a piece of the action.
