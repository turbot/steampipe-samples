Please share your insights, pitfalls and things to do&#x2F;avoid.<p>(I&#x27;m quite new to this area and extremely nervous, but I would like to at least patent one or two designs&#x2F;technology in my current company. I am already working on one; I will finish building it next week and pitch it. But it&#x27;s not something so amazing, just something that doesn&#x27;t exist yet, and it would be cool for some people if it did, I&#x27;m hoping. If they accept it, I have no idea how to progress.)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

My name is Alex and I am excited to share the project I have been working on: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;LanguageMate.io<p>I am aiming to turn LanguageMate into the world’s best language learning chatbot to enable you to have anxiety-free conversations with a chatbot in your target language and<p>The benefit to you is that you now have the daily opportunity, wherever you are, to practise speaking, writing, reading, and listening in your target language.<p>And practising your target language frequently is crucial to progress and grow your active vocabulary<p>It is completely free to make an initial account! That account will allow you to start your first conversations to practise one of the 19 languages on offer<p>The website currently guides you through different common real-world scenarios so you learn relevant vocabulary. It also provides a hint of progress at this early stage as to not overwhelm new users<p>I would be interested to hear your feedback as I have been busy recently speaking to other users who have been suggesting great ideas for enhancements!<p>Technically, I use ChatGPT’s new API to provide the other side of the conversations and  some other requests to Davinci and Curie for other areas such as translations, improvements, etc<p>I have also added some gamification elements so far to the website. I aim to be careful with this to not make it spammy but other language apps, namely Duolingo, have used these elements successfully to encourage users back to keep them progressing<p>I look forward to hearing your thoughts",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
