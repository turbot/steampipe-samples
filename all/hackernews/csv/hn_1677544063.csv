Even if they&#x27;re deleted on Hacker News, they&#x27;ll be saved on hLog. It looks for new posts every 3 minutes.<p>It also has a basic search that looks at the title, url and submission text (if any).
It&#x27;s not optimised in terms of pagination of results (nor the actual page content). If you press &quot;Search&quot; without anything in the search box, you&#x27;ll get a list of all the records in the database. There are around 4,200 right now.<p>I wrote it in Python (Django) using SQLite3. It runs on a free VPS hosted on Oracle Cloud. I wrote this mainly to improve my understanding of Django. I&#x27;m mainly a backend guy but i want to build some frontend skills and i thought a project like this would allow me to learn that.<p>Any feedback would be much appreciated, even if it&#x27;s negative. I know there are hundreds (if not thousands) of HN mirrors&#x2F;clones out there, but this is for my learning. If you could suggest any improvements, i may be able to learn new things i otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have.",story,https://hlog.pro,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Each upvote felt significant and Product of Day or Month meant something. I was addicted to it like many people are addicted to HN. I used to check the front page multiple times a day.<p>However, with the onset of COVID-19, the platform underwent a strange transformation. The quality of the products featured began to dwindle, with many of them being nothing more than Notion templates, Airtable lists, and design collections. In fact, it became a challenge to find a genuinely innovative product amid the sea of mediocre offerings.<p>Months would pass without a single noteworthy release, and Product Hunt started to feel like a hub for deceptive bundle and templates selling snake oil salesmen.<p>Witnessing the platform&#x27;s decline in this manner has been heartbreaking, particularly since I began my own product journey inspired by the groundbreaking products I discovered on Product Hunt in the past.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
