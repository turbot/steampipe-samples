The requirement is that you need to be a mid-developer at least but also do support all day.<p>We&#x27;re having a super hard time finding someone that wants to do this even when paying over the mid-dev rate.<p>Developers hate support or any kind of prolonged client interaction, support guys don&#x27;t have technical experience. Besides that, it takes 2 months minimum of training for a tech support position to get remotely productive, it actually starts at 3-4 month mark.<p>After all the time the team spends on training them and they start to actually deliver something, we&#x27;re seeing them fleeing away to a full dev job on some other place.<p>We just spent months on interview and training and they leave exactly when they start to become helpful. Since we&#x27;re a very small company of 7, this affects us a lot.<p>I&#x27;m very frustrated about this. Do you guys have any idea on how to handle this?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
