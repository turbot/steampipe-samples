34949509,Show HN: SupaRes – AI-powered image enhancement platform,2023-02-26T21:13:12Z,matylla,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN,<p>A few days back we launched SupaRes which is an image restoration&#x2F;enhancement platform. What I think is unique about that product is that it offers not only general single-image super-resolution but also a few other enhancements such as automatic white-balance, denoising, tone improvement, or low-light boost.<p>We have some customers in our regular business [1] who requested something more than &quot;just&quot; image optimization and processing. We&#x27;ve put together a few custom models for them and, after a while, decided to rewrite the whole thing and launch it as a separate product which is now SupaRes.<p>Most of the neural nets are PyTorch reimplementation of TF models while the others are trained from scratch on synthetic data to boost performance in certain verticals such as real estate or food.<p>On the backend, we use Node for general apps and microservices which are managed by k8s. Rendering engine is obviously written in Python with Sanic being our framework of choice. We&#x27;re running on bare-metal colocated in Frankfurt&#x2F;DE and have two machines with 2 x A40 (48GB) each at our disposal. We are members of NVIDIA Inception program and that helped us secure GPUs at preferential prices. To avoid CUDA OOM every GPU has its dedicated Redis-based task queue where we manage inference requests.<p>SupaRes is really just a beginning for us in the image restoration space but I&#x27;m very happy with what we&#x27;ve built so far. I personally think it looks nice on the frontend and, most importantly, does a really good job enhancing degraded visuals.<p>Dropping this here as maybe some of you will find the service useful.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;optidash.ai"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;optidash.ai</a>",story,https://supares.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Devs use an editor (VS Code) to write code and then test it like normal. Then, the code can be played back in a browser and the author can add a narrative about its evolution. The narrative can include text, code highlights, hand drawn pictures, screenshots, audio&#x2F;video files, and Q&amp;A&#x27;s. I call them &#x27;code playbacks&#x27; (follow the link to see some examples in one of my &#x27;books&#x27;).<p>I have been making collections of these and using them instead of textbooks in the programming-focused CS courses that I teach for the last couple of years. My students don&#x27;t like traditional programming books much anymore. They like videos but I don&#x27;t think they are ideal for teaching with code. They have responded really well to the code playbacks.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about making a new site to host these so that anyone can sell (or share for free) their collections of playbacks. Users would also be able to make professional portfolios to show potential employers how they think about and communicate with code.<p>I don&#x27;t really consider myself a web developer but I am pretty sure I can learn what I need to in order to build this. My dilemma is whether I should or not. Are playbacks a valuable enough new medium? Can they disrupt the traditional programming book market? Should I create a startup and write all of the code myself (probably slowly)? Should I raise money? Find a co-founder? Hire a seasoned web dev team? I&#x27;m looking for advice on next steps.",story,https://markm208.github.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
