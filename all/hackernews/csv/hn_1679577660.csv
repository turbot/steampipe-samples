The more I learn about her the more I am amazed. I really wish I&#x27;d met her.<p>Oddly, I just found out she wrote a book (and I call myself a fan ... HA).<p>It appears she&#x27;s had a rough road in life.<p>I think this book is somewhat relevant to the hacker community. I know a few people who have had difficulties and find solace in solitary programming or gaming. It is easier to interact with machines than people.

I&#x27;ve noticed that Midjourney uses Discord as its interface, which is why I thought it&#x27;d be helpful to create an API for it.<p>I&#x27;m curious, has anyone else wondered why Midjourney uses Discord? Personally, I think it&#x27;s an interesting choice, but it may not be for everyone. That being said, if you&#x27;re interested in trying out a different way of interacting with Midjourney, feel free to check out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenextleg.io.<p>I also created a 1-minute YouTube video to demonstrate how to use the tool, which you can find here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nLC1xq_2yAM.<p>Let me know your thoughts on Midjourney and Discord, and if you have any questions or feedback about The Next Leg, please feel free to share!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
