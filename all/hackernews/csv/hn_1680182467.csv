The only requirement I have is fully remote work. Still, no answer whatsoever. Not even spam from the recruiters anymore. My resume lists half of the things I have worked on, but no point in making two pages long if no one even reads the first one. Even HN direct contacts have gone nowhere.<p>This is majorly impacting my self-confidence, and I am at a point that I will have to drop my 11+ year consulting career for full time employment.
