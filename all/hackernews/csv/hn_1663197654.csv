I&#x27;m part of a new project consisting of a dozen teams.
My one job is to implement a small REST API.
Product &amp; management made it a requirement for me to add this new API to an existing back-end service owned by an external team; customers complained they didn&#x27;t want to integrate with yet another new service.<p>However, the team that owns this back-end service won&#x27;t accept my change. They aren&#x27;t blocking a PR even. Just off the spec, this team decided the API doesn&#x27;t fit the responsibility of their service. I want to stay anon so let&#x27;s say their service makes Pizza &amp; I&#x27;m supposed to add Spaghetti. Blasphemy to a pizza chef but to our customers, it&#x27;s all just Italian food.<p>I understand both sides tbh but I&#x27;ve zero decision making power in my role to unblock this. All I can do is facilitate meetings between PM and the rejecting team but sadly these calls never go anywhere. It&#x27;s been 3 months of this now. Product&#x2F;management insist on their vision, this team insists on theirs.<p>Any advice on how I could move this forward? Am I doing something obviously wrong here?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
