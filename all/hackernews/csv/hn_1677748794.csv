34993641,Show HN: Build a knowledge base from your Slack content,2023-03-02T09:08:24Z,mariarmestre,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HNers!<p>We are Maria and Stuart from DataQA (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dataqa.ai&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dataqa.ai&#x2F;</a>). We want to make sure companies never &quot;lose&quot; important information on Slack. We have built a Slack app to easily bookmark and tag important content, such as announcements, FAQs or actionable decisions, and save it inside an internal knowledge base. All inside of Slack.<p>Anyone who uses Slack regularly will be  aware of its shortcomings when it comes to the amount of noise that can be generated. Even with the best of intentions, companies can easily end up with too many noisy channels, where relevant discussions happen at the same time as more informal chats. This is not only a distraction for people, but is also a problem when trying to go back and search past history for important information. The data in Slack is proprietary knowledge of companies and should not get locked inside the Slack platform.<p>Both Stuart and I have felt this pain at our previous jobs. How do we solve this problem? With DataQA, you can save important messages or threads in the form of question-answer pairs, and tag them with relevant tags, e.g. #front-end-updates. All the saved content is then displayed in the Slack app home page, no need to login to another service. The app also comes with search, as well as a bot to quickly access all the saved knowledge.<p>We only see what we need to see: the app only has access to the channels it&#x27;s invited to, and all data gets deleted if the app gets uninstalled from the workspace.<p>We are offering the app for free at the moment, and would love to hear feedback from the HN community!",story,https://dataqa.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
