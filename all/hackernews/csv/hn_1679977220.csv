(Or replace SaaS with any of “cloud”, “platform”, etc)<p>I hypothesize that <i>lots</i> of time and effort is being duplicated by teams migrating an integration and wasting a lot of time before realizing a service has severe drawbacks. My most recent project was to integrate AWS Cognito (authentication solution) a few years ago before aspects of it were very immature for customer-facing purposes.<p>It’s easy to find lots of PR &#x2F; sales material that focuses on the positive side of platforms (the 5 star reviews). I’m more interested in collecting the 1-3 star reviews as they can help identify likely pitfalls before investing too much hope in one implementation.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
