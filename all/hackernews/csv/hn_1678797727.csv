Shared 50&#x2F;50 for a startup equity. It took some time, we build 1st version of product, had some clients, then paused. And last year revampted the product and have a new product now.<p>Problem: I have impression that I am the only person who motivated him and us, who has ideas. I setup landing page, product roadmap, notion project pages, I look for clients, conduct demos, create a demo script. recently I decided we need to new hosting ( amazon).<p>Last year we had some turbulance because of that and I almost led to break up, because it was frustrating me. 
My mistake that I have ignored that before. 
Last year we talked, he said the startup is important, but he works only on weeknd on that.<p>Now it has been anotehr year, and again I am in the same place, feeling like I always need to push and that if I woud not write to him, he will not do it himself. e.q. I initiated moving to new hosting, scheduled calls with amazon and consultants. And him being technical &lt; I expect him to write at least some emails. But again it is me, who is cinducting communication. And asking him, if he seen email from amazon with instruction how we should proceed.<p>So, I understand it is not how I want the work look like. I taked to him last year ( hard conversation, seemed to be improved), but now it is the same. We have a beta product, which we can publish on appsumo and producthunt and move forward. But I feel like I am burnedout and scared to move even further.<p>Maybe it makes sense stop Now, do not waste time and just tell him, we stop woking, sell the product and I just move on, find aotehr cofoudner and create a better porudct from scratch.<p>I am lost and maybe there is someone who can advise me.  even during the call, he says I am coding. 
I love being the way I am- proactive, but my energy cant be enough for both, especially when there are hard times finding clients and some difficulties.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
