34053669,Ask HN: Are you using Notion and its recent Notion AI feature?,2022-12-19T16:07:07Z,lma21,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Notion (the free plan). I&#x27;ve used it to store personal (not too personal) documents such as tech notes, grocery items, blog snippets, quotes from books i&#x27;ve read, etc.<p>Recently I started using it at work as well to store notes from meetings, logging my work journal, my to-do list, and other elements as well (like a scratchpad). Notion has been approved by our security team, and it was important that we don&#x27;t put any company-confidential information in our notes (which I avoid doing at all costs).<p>I wanted to activate the Notion AI feature today (as I received an email that i&#x27;m off the waitlist). I started reading AI program terms[1], which led me to the Master Subscription Agreement[2], which also led me to the Data Processing Addendum[3].<p>The following paragraph (in [1]) captured my interest:<p><pre><code>   &gt; You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (“Input”), and receive output generated and returned by the Notion AI based on the Input (“Output”). Input and Output are your Content or Customer Data, as applicable. You will ensure that your Input and use of the Notion AI will not violate any applicable law. You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of your Content and Customer Data.

</code></pre>
What does it mean for Notion to process our input (customer data) to help its AI? How safe is this? What do you think of it? Would you use it given how these terms are coined?<p>I continued reading the Data Processing Addendum[3] and also noticed the following paragraph in the <i>Data Use and Processing</i> section:<p><pre><code>    &gt; The parties acknowledge and agree that Customer is the Controller of Customer Personal Data and Notion is the Processor of such Customer Personal Data. Notion shall Process Customer Personal Data as a service provider strictly for the business purpose(s) agreed between the parties and as provided under the Agreement, this DPA, and any instructions expressly agreed upon by the parties in writing (together, the &quot;Business Purpose&quot;). 

</code></pre>
How do you think Notion processes Customer Personal Data for its &quot;Business Purpose&quot;? I couldn&#x27;t find any detailed explanation of the &quot;Business Purpose&quot; in the Master Subscription Agreement[2] or Personal Use Terms of Service[4] or Data Processing Addendum[3].<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;Notion-AI-Program-Terms-c0066e3003904176bb50b9f7c16164b9<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;Master-Subscription-Agreement-4e1c5dd3e3de45dfa4a8ed60f1a43da0#ab40a767dcd04b10b58512a964b928f0<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;Data-Processing-Addendum-361b540101274b1fa7e16b90402b0d99#cfce81e82e31431d9a2cfe87699f7710<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;Personal-Use-Terms-of-Service-00e4e5d0f2b9411cbee6493f15779500#4c8b3847a1874ce7abcef66829ca71e4<p>PS: anyone else finds it quite difficult to read terms of use and agreements like this?

34053283,"Show HN: ByteSync – A smart data sync solution for Windows, Linux and macOS",2022-12-19T15:36:34Z,paulfresquet,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN!
I&#x27;m Paul, from France, and I&#x27;m the creator of ByteSync, a brand new data synchronization solution available on Windows, Linux &amp; macOS (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bytesyncapp.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bytesyncapp.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>==WHY==<p>In my previous job, I frequently had to check if large files were identical on remote, cross-platform and often changing repositories and I had to synchronize them when they were not. With the existing solutions on the market, the implementation of these operations was often too long and tedious for my taste.<p>So I started developing ByteSync and extended it as I went along.<p>==WHAT==<p>The main goal of ByteSync is to transfer or synchronize data using an rsync-like protocol (diff-based) over the Internet, with very fast deployment, multi-directional synchronization and up to 5 remote or local clients running on Windows, Linux and macOS!<p>ByteSync does this by leveraging the cloud and rsync together. 
Here are the main features of the software:<p>- Very fast deployment: download, unzip or install, and it&#x27;s ready!<p>- Remote and local backup via a session system with 1-5 local and remote clients<p>- Remote security through end-to-end encryption with AES-256<p>- Smart and optimized data analysis<p>- Transfer only file differences and share transfer buffers<p>- Native applications for Windows, Linux and macOS, with the same user interface and features.<p>==WATCH==<p>You can discover the Cloud Synchronization mode in video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0XJhdSRcmwE"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0XJhdSRcmwE</a><p>==HOW==<p>The solution is based on several modern technologies, including .NET 6, AvaloniaUI, Azure and SignalR.
Working over the Cloud, it embeds end-to-end encryption and client authentication based on RSA key pairs.<p>The software is available in portable and installable versions for Windows and Linux, and in DMG format for macOS. 
ByteSync is a proprietary and commercial application. It will be available with both free and paid versions when released.<p>==BETA==<p>Be aware you that the solution is not yet production-ready. ByteSync is currently Beta Software!<p>==TRY.IT==<p>There are 2 ways to try the solution:<p>- Either you join the open beta on <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bytesyncapp.com&#x2F;#beta"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bytesyncapp.com&#x2F;#beta</a>. You&#x27;ll get the benefits of registration, such as access to support tickets to discuss developments and issues, and discounts that you can use when we start selling the solution.<p>- Or you don&#x27;t register and use generic logins specific to HN community.

This would also require an Amazon music subscription.<p>Ideally, users would subscribe through a created service and then behind the scenes the service accesses the music streaming library, not requiring an existing music service subscription.  It would be nice as well to have access to high fidelity streams like those available on Qobuz or Tidal.<p>Do any of these exist or is this pretty much not possible in this industry.<p>Thanks ;)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
