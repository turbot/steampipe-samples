I just wanted to share a change I made in my life recently. Yeah. The cold shower itself was actually pretty terrible but now I’m feeling pretty great. This is not my first time though; I&#x27;ve been taking cold showers for the past weeks. At first I started doing them to recover faster (soon I’ll be 30 and I’ve set the goal to get there in the best shape of my life). But now I&#x27;ve incorporated them in my longevity framework as part of my day to day. Anyone else is doing cold showers or ice baths? I’d love to know more people doing this and your experience with it.,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
