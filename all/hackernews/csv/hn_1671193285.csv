Must be nonnegative.&quot;<p>I should have known this but I didn&#x27;t and when I tried this in Google I had to check several pages with not as good solutions like &quot;just make the px count the same, i.e: 400px vs 400px&quot; until I reached w3school ratio explanation with padding-bottom.<p>I just wanted to share this small example that really helped me and might be useful for others.<p>PS: For anyone reading this, have a nice Christmas and if you don&#x27;t celebrate Christmas I hope you enjoy your festivities.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
