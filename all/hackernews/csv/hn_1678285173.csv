I&#x27;m excited to share my latest project with you - RepeatGPT, a web app that allows you to schedule recurring executions of ChatGPT and receive the results via email.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: You simply provide a prompt or question to ChatGPT, select a frequency and time for the executions (e.g. daily at 9am), and enter your email address. RepeatGPT takes care of the rest, running the ChatGPT model on the specified schedule and sending you the generated text via email.<p>Some fun example prompts:
- Daily: Give me an inspirational quote
- Weekly: Give me 10 uncommon Spanish words and their english translation
- Daily: Here are 7 tasks: Monday - Research LLMs, …. Give me today&#x27;s task and 5 bullet points on how to achieve it.<p>Really, your imagination is the limit! Can&#x27;t wait to see what you&#x27;ll come up with. =)<p>Please give RepeatGPT a try and let me know what you think!
