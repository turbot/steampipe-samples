Let&#x27;s discuss:<p>The question is simple:
Is it correct that most student who do competitive programming stay unemployed ?
Give me your honest opinion.<p>My Opinion:
Yes,They remain unemployed.
a) As Industry is maturing day by day,most companies want to hire senior developers.Hiring for junior developers has slowed down.
b) Most of the well reputed product based companies have their engineering offices in US where there is infinite supply of fresh grads from premier research institutes.Even these grads are finding it tough to land a job.
c) Not all companies are interested in competitive programming contest-it depends on the company,hiring manager,team.
d) Let&#x27;s say you are from Eastern Europe&#x2F;Russia,China,India,Korea,Japan or other low income countries,hell even from US&#x2F;Western EU.No company would like to import you just because you won a contest.(This is because these companies are only interested in hiring senior developers.)
e) Competitive programming is about solving artificial problems having artificial constraint.Solving such problems doesn&#x27;t guarantee that you can solve complex problems at professional level.
f) FAANG Interviews are conducted to filter out candidate&#x27;s who can&#x27;t code.It is possible to pass these interviews without CP experience.I personally know lot of such developers.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34996977,How I found user accounts in my SaaS tools that should have been offboarded,2023-03-02T15:38:05Z,mathiasn,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN,<p>I am curious what you think about open sourcing a little tool I wrote. But before, let me give you some background: I was building two fintech companies before and we had several audits per year. As the financial industry is regulated, it wasn’t a “voluntary” audit like SOC2, ISO27001 or HIPAA. Hard findings posed the risk of not being able to do business anymore.<p>One of the high priority auditor items was having a proper access management process to ensure that user accounts of former employees are revoked and existing users follow least-privilege principle. Even when we used Okta, in many cases we couldn’t get the data in an automated way. Either tools were not covered or behind a (way too high) paywall. Thanks SSO Tax<p>Back then I wrote a little tool to download user lists with their permissions from our major SaaS tools. That helped us a lot to verify user lists. Later I even added functionality for some tools to create and delete user accounts as this was another pain we got.<p>However, I am thinking about making the tool open source with support for a bunch of applications that can be easily extended.<p>Would such a tool be useful for you? Are there any other information besides users and permissions you would find important? Would you see yourself contributing to a open source project like that?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
34997357,Asset Sale vs. Stock Sale,2023-03-02T16:01:52Z,DellaK-CPA,1,false,false,,,,,,"Stock Sale vs Asset Sale<p>Most small business sales are asset sales, meaning you are buying all the assets of the business, but not the entity itself. The assets probably include the name, the phone number, the client list, the website, any company vehicles, the computers, and the equipment. They are not buying your LLC or S Corp unless it’s a stock sale.<p>In a stock sale, the buyer takes over your entity by purchasing the shares of your business, similar to buying shares in AT&amp;T or McDonald&#x27;s. In a stock sale, the buyer takes over your bank account, your payroll accounts, all your liabilities, your accounts receivable and everything else you can think of.<p>The rule of thumb is, ”what’s good for the seller is bad for the buyer, and vice versa”. As a seller, you would prefer to sell your stock, because then your entire sale would be considered capital gains. Capital gain is the best type of income to have. It has the lowest tax rate and sometimes that rate is even zero. But, this will put the buyer at a disadvantage for tax purposes.<p>Depreciation is a group of random rules made up by the government telling you how you are allowed to write off business assets. You can’t write off or depreciate stock. If your buyer acquires your company in a stock sale, there will be nothing for them to depreciate. Whereas, if they buy your assets, your equipment, they can take full depreciation of those assets even if you had already depreciated them. That will go a long way to easing the buyer&#x27;s tax burden.
The rule &quot;what&#x27;s good for the seller is bad for the buyer&quot; is true within an asset sale as well. If you go the route of an asset sale, you and your buyer will need to allocate the total purchase price amongst all the assets involved in the sale. If you sell your business for $900K, you will need to negotiate how much of that $900K will be allocated to the equipment, how much will be allocated to the client list, how much will be allocated to the non-compete agreement, and how much will be allocated to goodwill. And yes, what’s good for the seller here, is bad for the buyer. That’s why it needs to be part of the negotiation. This allocation will determine how much you pay in taxes and how much and how fast your buyer can write off the purchase. The allocation also needs to be reported on the tax returns of both the buyer and the seller, so hopefully they match.<p>Without good tax planning, for example, that $900K business sale could result in $600K or less going into your pocket. Don’t finalize any deal terms until you’ve analyzed it through the tax lens.<p>Taxes must be considered UPFRONT, not as a deal afterthought.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34997445,Show HN: We added ChatGPT to our documentation to make them fully portable,2023-03-02T16:06:07Z,snide,5,false,false,1,[34997585],,,,"TLDR: Check out our documentation search here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xata.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xata.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;overview</a><p>Hello HN. I&#x27;m a designer over at Xata. We build a serverless database platform on top of Postgres and Elastic-like search that provides goodies like a native TypeScript client for type support in your IDE. Long story short, we&#x27;re trying to bundle all the normal stuff you need out of a database along with branching, so you don&#x27;t have to glue everything together.<p>Today we added a new &#x2F;ask&#x2F; endpoint to our search product that bundles in ChatGPT support into any stored data. Why would you want this, you might ask? Fantastic question. Let&#x27;s say you have a bunch of documentation stored in OpenAPI with a jumble of random markdown files in a Github repo. Sound familiar? With Xata you could push that content into a Xata DB on publish, and immediately get text and vector based search against that content. The new &#x2F;ask&#x2F; endpoint only needs some rules, and suddenly you have natural language responses. Because it&#x27;s all just markdown, you can then render the response back in your documentation site with syntax highlighting and all that goodness.<p>Ok yeah, yeah. Docs chat. I get it. What makes this really cool is that because the content is now in a database, along with those endpoints, our documentation is suddenly portable. We can now provide helpful links throughout the product that ask &quot;How do search boosts work?&quot; that can answer things inline without linking you somewhere. We&#x27;re still kicking the tires on this stuff, but it&#x27;s nice to get the authoring experience of writing markdown in Github repos and seeing it suddenly show up anywhere, not just a static website. Obviously there&#x27;s more you can do with it than this docs uses case, but it&#x27;s the one we wanted to build for ourselves.<p>Here&#x27;s a 5-minute video that explains the basics along with some other resources if you want to build something similar yourself.<p>Video<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pbH9OHXvok0"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pbH9OHXvok0</a><p>The new ask endpoint<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xata.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api-reference&#x2F;db&#x2F;db_branch_name&#x2F;tables&#x2F;table_name&#x2F;ask#ask-table"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xata.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api-reference&#x2F;db&#x2F;db_branch_name&#x2F;tables&#x2F;...</a><p>A deeper technical dive on how this works<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xata.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;chatgpt-on-your-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xata.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;chatgpt-on-your-data</a><p>A starter repo with examples against Pokemon!<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xataio&#x2F;examples&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;apps&#x2F;sample-chatgpt"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xataio&#x2F;examples&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;apps&#x2F;sample-cha...</a>",story,https://xata.io/chatgpt,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
