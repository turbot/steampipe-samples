As a retail customer, twice I was asked by Enterprise staff to spend my free time and take their vehicle, which I was paying for, to a Pep Boys or NTB and have the oil change service performed.<p>Then when I also found out via Discount Tire that one of the tires was mounted improperly, the Enterprise position was &quot;please have them take a look at that too&quot; and, let&#x27;s be clear here, I was paying for what I thought was a usable, safe vehicle.<p>The worst part about it was there was no consideration of my personal time or efforts and it was made worse by the clear, very clear guilt trip being employed by Enterprise:<p>&quot;Please help us out, the technician guys have called and I just need to update them&quot;<p>&quot;Oh you didn&#x27;t do it yet? Please you know there&#x27;s a lot of pressure&quot;<p>Those aren&#x27;t exact quotes but they don&#x27;t need to be. I&#x27;m telling the truth and I&#x27;ve escalated it with my Insurance Agent because Enterprise was the preferred vendor and I got stuck with them due to other incompetence by service providers.<p>So, if you remember their old customer friendly slogan about &quot;Pick Enterprise and we&#x27;ll pick you up&quot; it&#x27;s time for an update as in &quot;Pick Enterprise and we&#x27;ll pick on you for profit.&quot;",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
