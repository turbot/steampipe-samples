Long time reader here who finally left a desk job in embedded systems a few years ago to start my own company (Musik Hack) as the technical chops, with my co-founder Stan coming from the music business. It&#x27;s been really inspiring to read so many stories here, so I&#x27;m proud to be going through the motions myself!<p>I&#x27;m sharing our first product, Master Plan, an audio plugin for mastering music. We took all the stuff required to turn a decent mix into a major-label quality release and jammed it into one easy-to-digest tool. Then we amped it up with a very special loudness circuit that outperforms some industry standbys and competitors in listening tests. I&#x27;m very excited to share and hear what you think, especially if you&#x27;ve got an opinion about how our loudness circuit is doing compared to whatever you&#x27;re currently using.<p>MasterPlan runs as a VST, AU, or AAX audio plugin on Mac (Intel&#x2F;Apple Silicon) and Windows. It does require an email address to use, but that&#x27;s it (no password, 2 factor, or otherwise).<p>----<p>PS: If you haven&#x27;t heard of &quot;mastering,&quot; but got this far anyway, it most obviously increases perceived loudness. It also brings out the most pleasing bits of whatever material it started with (like salt does to food). Mastering also helps your track sound good on all sorts of devices, whether they fit in your ear or hang above a stage.

35391777,PSA: Always specify the LLM model,2023-03-31T19:03:27Z,Cyphase,1,false,false,,,,,,"There are many comments here on HN (and elsewhere) where people talk about &quot;ChatGPT&quot; or &quot;GPT&quot; without specifying whether it&#x27;s GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 (or others even). Then other people point that out and say that if they haven&#x27;t tried GPT-4 yet, they should.<p>And there are likely many more where it&#x27;s not explicit, but a discussion is still taking place between someone who&#x27;s only used 3.5 and someone who&#x27;s used 4, and they&#x27;re disagreeing about capabilities.<p>And there are other LLM models out there, so &quot;LLMs&quot; is non-specific, which can sometimes cause imprecision or confusion in a discussion.<p>So it would be great if people who haven&#x27;t tried GPT-4 yet and are willing and able to do so, did so. And if you haven&#x27;t, don&#x27;t want to, or can&#x27;t, then provide that clarification in the discussion.<p>In addition, it would help if everyone stopped only saying &quot;ChatGPT&quot; and started saying &quot;GPT-3.5&quot; and &quot;GPT-4&quot;.
