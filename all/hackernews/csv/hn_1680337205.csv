35398054,Ask HN: To what did you changed PHP?,2023-04-01T07:28:51Z,anonymous344,2,false,false,1,[35398150],,,,"I&#x27;ve been web dev now 20 years or so. Designing and building tiny, small and medium web apps.
My problem is that php is hated. I have a feeling there is something better?
But for me it just worked nicely without needing to update all the libraries and deps every month because that&#x27;s not what the customers are paying and that&#x27;s not what I want to do. But now with php8x more problems are arising..<p>So what programming language and stack do you use as backend these days?
1. How much does it cost to run (small user base) php is like 7$ &#x2F; month hosted, no need to maintain linux updates or any of that stuff
2. Does it need constant updating ? Haven&#x27;t updated many of my or customer&#x27;s apps in 5 years
3. How many times you had proken libraries and stuff debugging some errors ? with php and wordpress for example this is almost monthly
4. How does it scale ? for example to 20 000 - 200 000 daily users",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
