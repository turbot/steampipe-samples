They are a fantastic solution to a problem I have, especially now that they are in so many locations. However, something is giving me pause.<p>The companies that run these coworking spaces are naturally in a very privileged position to learn a lot about a person&#x27;s business and projects. You&#x27;re under their roof, in an open space or in a glass-walled office, working under the visibility of their cameras (reasonable to assume equipped with microphones capable of picking up conversations), using their internet (likely monitored and possibly logged), and their staff is interacting with people who come to meet with you. Ultimately, if they wanted to, they could figure out exactly what you&#x27;re working on and who your clients are. This isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s giving me pause.<p>In order to make this a non-issue, I assumed these companies would provide a solid statement (no loopholes) in the member contract that they won&#x27;t use and won&#x27;t share what they are able to learn about my business and will keep whatever they learn in confidence. But...none of the spaces I contacted offer a sufficient statement to this effect. This is what&#x27;s giving me pause.<p>Do you use a coworking space? If so, did you find a solution to this issue?
