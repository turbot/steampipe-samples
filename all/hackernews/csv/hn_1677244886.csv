It&#x27;s not limited to GitHub and other major platforms and even works with each service, which is accessible over SSH.<p>First you must install SSH-MITM. It&#x27;s recommended to use the AppImage, because this works out of the box on most Linux machines.<p>$ wget https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ssh-mitm&#x2F;ssh-mitm&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest&#x2F;download&#x2F;ssh-mitm-x86_64.AppImage
$ chmod +x ssh-mitm-x86_64.AppImage<p>To check the publickey, you can use following command:<p>$ .&#x2F;ssh-mitm-x86_64.AppImage audit check-publickey --host github.com --username git --public-key ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;id_rsa.pub<p>If the key is known you will get &quot;valid key&quot; otherwise &quot;bad key&quot;.<p>Note: since this uses SSH to verify, if the key is known, it&#x27;s not possible to get the username. The reason is, GitHub and other code hosters uses &quot;git&quot; as the username.<p>This technique can be used not only on GitHub. It&#x27;s also possible to check if a user has access to a public SSH server. If you have some usernames and publickeys, those can be used to check if a valid combination is known by the server, without having the private key or other valid credentials to login.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
