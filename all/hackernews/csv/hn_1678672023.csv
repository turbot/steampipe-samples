35129036,Any resources for new video game programmers to become more creative?,2023-03-13T00:53:47Z,budoso,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN, I&#x27;d like to do more games programming as a hobby, but I generally struggle to balance my creativity with also learning games programming concepts (I&#x27;m a full time backend SW engineer). I think my biggest issue is that art creation (for assets) is not something I have experience in, and generally game creation tutorials skip this part and include a zip of pre-created assets.<p>Are there any good resources&#x2F;courses that provide a more guided environment, with both art tutorials and ideas for good beginner games?<p>I understand the most important thing is to just start making games, but I struggle to get over the hurdles of creating art and coming up with skill appropriate game ideas, any some structure in my learning might help. FYI I&#x27;m using Godot Engine. Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
