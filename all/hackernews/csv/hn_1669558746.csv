33762805,Ask HN: Could the Wallaby EV NEV be a reason for Russia to change course?,2022-11-27T13:29:58Z,WallabyEV,1,false,false,1,[33763014],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello, as the inventor of the Wallaby EV, a clean-sheet innovation in the US DOT Neighborhood Electric Vehicle (NEV) class, I am seeking practical methods to get these into the market. My priorities are to enable markets with semi-skilled labor and no viable manufacturing industry of note to be a location for a Wallaby EV plant. This is also a maneuver to minimize the incentive to just copy outright (but there&#x27;s waaaay too much special sauce baked in to even come close to safety&#x2F;performance&#x2F;features) because there&#x27;s a new game in town that pays well and helps people do real work.<p>My thought is that Russia is currently lacking domestic production and innovation on the global scale, and if offered an alternative to military industry, that it would be a viable and recognizable pivot for the benefit of Russia and its people.<p>For all I care they can burn all the CNG they want to make electricity and convert to EV. Then maybe the global petroleum market can begin to feel a change from a genuine leader - Russia. They hold a powerful position and I recognize that as any intelligent person should do right away.<p>I also acknowledge the difficulty of cultural mistrust - a lot of that I assert is generational. I believe Russians my age or younger (40 something) do care deeply about their national integrity and security. This is why I believe an incentive and acknowledgement of mutual benefit may be reasonable to offer and potentially get consideration.<p>Personally I&#x27;m tired of the suffering caused by arguments that escalate - many personal reasons. I&#x27;ve seen the effects of war first-hand from US Marines who served in Fallujah II. Also in Hurricane Katrina cleanup.<p>Thus, I respect Mr. Putin and also see that he is intelligent and cunning and knows a good thing when he sees it. Especially if it&#x27;s obvious that the terms are beneficial to Russia as a whole and while it might not do much about the oligarchy structure at the top, my intent all along is to build better lives from the bottom up. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so simple and cheap to manufacture and I had to get my protections in line first.<p>Anything I can do to reduce the likelihood of a hot nuclear conflict in my lifetime or that of my family is a viable pursuit. Yes the odds are against me. However if I don&#x27;t communicate the concept then it can&#x27;t be shared with my intended audience.<p>Disclosure: I have already reached out to the Kingdom of Nepal with a similar offer because I befriended a half-dozen of them here in Texas and love their culture and work ethic and they fit in GREAT here. I kinda bet I&#x27;d do okay there. Would be the trip of a lifetime for this guy!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
