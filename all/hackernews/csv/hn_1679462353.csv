35257039,Ask HN: Couldn't AI be used to do hash function inversion?,2023-03-22T05:03:57Z,graderjs,2,false,false,,,,,,"It seems to me that in some way, AI is sort of like a hash function inverter. You give it a small input, that&#x27;s sort of representative of the larger idea you want, and then it expands that, somewhat randomly, into a larger message.<p>Couldn&#x27;t you somehow hook this up with hash collision finding algorithms, and produce a (possibly only modicum of improvement) on hash function inversion?<p>I think this is interesting because a good hash function has an invertible mixing function, but is non-invertible overall. So being able to hack the &quot;trapdoor&quot; or &quot;one way&quot; nature of hash functions using AI would seem like a kind of cool escape hatch on what is supposedly &quot;mathematically possible&quot;.<p>Which maybe means it&#x27;s wrong to think you can &quot;invert a hash function&quot; with AI somehow, but I think it&#x27;s interesting to think about.<p>Especially in cases where you have &quot;content aware hashing&quot; with an assumption of secrecy owing to the one way nature of it, maybe AI could be used to &quot;reconstruct an image&quot; from a compressed representation, in the same way that it is being used to reconstruct imagery from &quot;dimensional embeddings&quot; gleaned from brain measurements, and analogous to how it is being considered for image compression.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just riffing out loud, but...anyone wanna continue the riff?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
