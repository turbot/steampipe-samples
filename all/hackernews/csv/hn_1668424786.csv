I started with a simple to-do app inside of Slack 5 years ago and we grew to a pretty robust platform with hundreds of features and thousands of customers. We run a small but profitable business.<p>Our API is in the core of our product and supports all our clients. Technically, if you are a user of Workast, you could build your own UI instead of using our web application. So, what if you are am app developer looking to add some kind of task management functionality to your app ? Using our API you could:<p>- Create tasks with summary, description, attachments, tags, due dates, assignees and followers
- Create subtasks with the same properties as a main task
- Comment on tasks with mentions
- Get reminders about tasks due soon
- Reports and robust search
- Create spaces and lists to group your tasks
- Create users and teams to segment your data
- We can send the user notifications via email with a white label &#x2F; custom template or send you the data to your own Webhook URL so you can deliver them yourself. 
- And many more features at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.workast.com<p>As a developer building all of that on your own would take a really long time. And even if you build it, then you have to support it and scale it as you grow. We could offer all these as a platform as a service, with some friendly pricing and free tier to get started.<p>Is this something that anyone here in HN would find valuable? Would love to hear your thoughts and work closely with those interested.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
