35195465,Show HN: Toy Wallet – A virtual bank for playing Monopoly with NFC support,2023-03-17T11:09:07Z,mwoelk,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN,<p>Yesterday I finally released my first App on the AppStore :)<p>It all began when we played Monopoly with a few friends and started running out of paper money quite often. I always loved the idea of the banking version of Monopoly (with the chip cards) so I decided to develop something similar as an app.<p>You can create multiple accounts (everyone can pick his favourite colour), and then transfer money to each other or to&#x2F;from the bank.<p>To prevent cheaters you can also either set a PIN for each account that has to be entered whenever money is being taken out or (if your device supports it) use a NFC (NTAG) card or token as authorization method.<p>We really love using the app in our family especially when playing it with NFC cards as it gives a real banking feeling :)<p>You can also start multiple games and pick up a game later if you need to interrupt playing.<p>I translated the app in as many languages possible but I guess there might be a lot of translation mistakes :)<p>I&#x27;m really looking forward to get some feedback from you folks on the app, what do you think I could improve? And please feel free to share any translaton mistake you have found.<p>- Max",story,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toy-wallet/id1670191633,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35195214,Ask HN: What it takes to build Jarvis using current state of the art LLMs?,2023-03-17T10:23:47Z,rohith2506,1,false,false,,,,,,"For people who don&#x27;t know Jarvis, it&#x27;s a know-it-all personal assistant which just doesn&#x27;t answer but also perform actions based on commands. It&#x27;s catered to specific person needs. We want this to run on your preferred device instead of cloud<p>I thought we were miles away from building something like this because of so many complex parts involved<p>1. State of the art speech to text generation ( Shout out to Whisper here )<p>2. State of the art question answering ( GPT-*, LLama, etc..)<p>3. Integration with your virtual life ( emails, music, finances etc..)<p>1 &amp; 2 have definitely shown significant progress. the major bottle neck right now is 3. Most of our virtual life is centralised and no one provides a clean API such that we can actually have a holistic view of everyone&#x27;s digital persona in one place. And last but not least, privacy and security is super important considering we are giving the total access to a bot. Am I missing anything else? Would like to see some healthy discussion on this topic",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I have no idea how this could have leaked and what my security status is now. I have some productivity apps on my mac with accessibility permissions to read my clipboard (yippy, zoom, teams, pgp), but i am not sure i have to assume one of these apps is compromised and wipe my whole machine.<p>Does anyone have any ideas about breaches not in haveibeenpwned or what a reasonable response would be or could chime in what they would do? I know in theory i would need to wipe my machine and then change all my passwords wich would take weeks, but i am not sure this is an overreaction.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
