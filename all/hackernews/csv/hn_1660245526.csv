32430406,Ask HN: Recommendations for Spaced Repetition Beginners?,2022-08-11T19:15:46Z,t_mann,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Someone posted a link to a Spaced Repetition article a few days ago [0]. I&#x27;d never heard of the concept before, and it sent me down a rabbit hole of different introductory and literature review articles [1-5], more in-depth discussions on how to adapt the method for more complex topics like mathematics, some previous HN discussions [9-11], various mainstream tools [12-15], as well as some tools currently being built by HN community members [16-18] (sorry if I missed anything important there).<p>I&#x27;ve also gotten started and created and practized my first few dozen flash cards on some new topics I recently learnt, and the first experience has left me wondering a few things:<p>1. Are there downsides to this? Most reviews seem highly appreciative mentioning practically no downsides besides the time commitment, which supposedly pays off many times over, which just always makes me skeptical. Downsides I could imagine include eg: recent neuroscience suggests that forgetting &amp; memory rearrangement are important elements of brain hygiene, related to decision-making, avoiding things like PTSD and others [19]. How sure are we that we&#x27;re not messing with those?<p>2. It seems that the most recommended approach is to turn things you want to remember into a set of atomic questions that take &lt;10s to answer. Are you aware of approaches that integrate better with note-taking? I wouldn&#x27;t reviewing an interesting essay or reproducing an elegant proof in full, not just small tidbits.<p>2a. + Any approaches that integrate well with journalling? I wouldn&#x27;t mind being reminded of a nice weekend trip with some pictures from time to time in a purely &#x27;here&#x27;s a nice memory&#x27; fashion, not questions like &#x27;Who did you go on a trip with on Feb 9 2020?&#x27;.<p>3. So the basic workflow I could much rather see myself adopting on a long-term basis is something like: take 10+10mins each day to write down what you learnt or did in the past 24h that seems worth remembering, and review things from previous days (with some spacing algorithm behind it, and an option to remove things entirely). Do you know if there is a name for that &#x2F; any science to it &#x2F; tools that support it (it seems the Ilse notebook might be going in that direction)?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32381206<p>Introductions:<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Spaced-repetition

I am here to demonstrate that, in 2022, every version of Windows 11 Enterprise (probably other editions too) includes a broad daylight Microsoft employee backdoor. You can verify it for yourself in the following manner: Go to Settings -&gt; Apps -&gt; Optional features. scroll down a bit and you will find a 3.12MB executable called &quot;Microsoft Quick Assist&quot;<p>What is Microsoft Quick Assist? Thankfully they even provided a description:
&quot;Allows Microsoft support agents to connect to your device and also lets you share your screen with someone you trust so that they can help you.&quot;<p>There you have it folks, unequivocal evidence of a backdoor for &quot;Microsoft support agents&quot; to access your device, pre-installed with every system, with no warning or option to disable it during initial setup. They have stealthily buried it deep in the settings where most people aren&#x27;t likely to discover it.<p>It was previously thought that if a backdoor existed in Windows it would only be accessible by high level Microsoft employees or perhaps need to be activated with a national security letter. Nope, they have quite brazenly given underpaid support agents in a foreign country who barely speak English the keys to the kingdom.<p>How many of you currently have this backdoor enabled and were unaware it existed?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
