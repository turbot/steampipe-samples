A friend of mine recently inherited a large Javascript codebase that’s not in great shape. We were brainstorming ways to measure “progress” towards cleaning it up to help others understand what’s going on - some ideas include P90 file &amp; function length, looking at import statements to determine the spaghetti-factor, and looking at the frequency of repeated chunks of code and general low effort code (poor variable names, n^2 loops, etc). We tried a few static analysis tools out there and didn&#x27;t find the thousands of &quot;errors&quot; they detected very helpful.<p>I’m curious how you intuitively judge the goodness of code, and whether that could be measured. Let me know if you’d like to see this as an open-source tool too, though the last thing I would want is yet another way to “measure developer productivity”.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
