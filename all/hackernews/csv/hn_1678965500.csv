It is my first SwiftUI project, and I have been (very) slowly building it since December &#x27;21. It aims to be fun and easy to use for small children, while not being another addictive app. We are using it almost daily, and in our (n=1) experience, it achieves just that: my 3-year-old loves to listen to music using Musikalia, but at the same time it never feels like he has problems leaving it again.<p>I&#x27;ve also written a bit on the back-story on my blog: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harry.vangberg.name&#x2F;posts&#x2F;musikalia&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harry.vangberg.name&#x2F;posts&#x2F;musikalia&#x2F;</a><p>I hope this may be useful for other families!<p>- Harry",story,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musikalia/id1633437142,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
