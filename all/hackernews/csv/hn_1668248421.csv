My one-year anniversary at my current job is coming up in a few weeks. Along with the anniversary I will have a &quot;year in review&quot; with my boss (department leader).<p>I am 36, it&#x27;s my first programming job after getting a BsC. in computer science and the company I work for sells app solutions that are basically off-the-shelf apps that are stylized and customized to each customer.<p>The problem is that I am basically not doing any real programming, and I even feel that I am regressing. I am paid very well, more than all of my friends from university, but work is incredibly boring and continuing with my current tasks won&#x27;t exactly improve my CV and development skills.<p>These are some of the problems:<p>- a lot of administrative overhead: a great lack of CI&#x2F;CD pipeline<p>- spending time arguing with UX: we are supposed to use standard components in Android&#x2F;iOS, but they make designs based on web that can&#x27;t be customized the same way, it sometimes stall tasks for days due to a lack of communication<p>- no real development tasks: it&#x27;s more about changing values and adding images to a specific customer than actually spending any time coding<p>- my colleagues either have little experience, or a lot of experience but without any understanding of design patterns, architecture, testing etc.<p>TLDR; I spend almost no time coding and most of it on styling, adding images and administrative tasks on backend. I absolute hate all of that.<p>The positive sides are:<p>- all my developer colleagues feel the same as I, but I have much less tolerance for how things are going<p>- I like everyone I work with, even the designers although they frustrate me<p>- my colleagues want the same improvements as I, but they aren&#x27;t tough enough to vocalize and press management about it<p>- my immediate boss knows that the situation is ideal and he knows we are understaffed and is pressuring to get more people<p>- the technical change to improve the current system is interesting and something I want to do, both CI&#x2F;CD, improve the structure and reusability of components in the system etc.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily feel that I have wasted a year, but I can&#x27;t help to wonder how I am regressing in programming skills due to what I am working with. I also despite the way things are set up and how much time is being spent micro-managing all of the manual systems. In a sense I am being burnt out because this kind of work is the exact opposite of what I want to do.<p>In a few weeks I will have the year in review meeting with my boss. I will be telling all of things and I won&#x27;t be holding back, we have a very good relationship and can be honest and up front. The thing is, can this actually be salvaged?<p>I will say that I cannot continue the way things are going, I will demand that improvements and actions are taken so that us developers actually spend time developing and not all of the other administrative stuff – things have to improve, and relatively fast. Especially since I told him during the interview what my goals were as a developer.<p>I have no doubts that my boss will take these things seriously, but my doubts lie more in how fast things can change and the ability to change as well – mostly because my colleagues are just continuing how things are going even if they are agreeing with me.<p>There are two basic questions I have from this:<p>1. should I switch jobs, or is there a chance this can be improved?<p>2. should I continue with iOS, or is it the norm that mobile apps that are mature basically end up in a continuous maintenance mode?<p>Personally I value knowing and utilizing certain principles like SOLID. Working with TDD is enjoyable for me, I like design and architecture patterns and creating smart solutions with CI&#x2F;CD. Optimization is a fun challenge and finding great solutions to a specific problem – whether is it for an entire app, system, or a particular important part of the system.<p>Thank you for reading the wall of text!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
