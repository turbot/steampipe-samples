There was an initial rough draft that was created by the patent counsel based on my verbal description. The rough draft had factual errors and used low quality MS-Paint drawings that I created solely for the sake of explaining the concept. As far as I can tell, they&#x27;re moving ahead with filing the patent in its current state, and I&#x27;m listed as the sole inventor.<p>Before I was laid off, I told them that it needs editing, but they went ahead and filed it anyway.<p>I&#x27;m really concerned about how this is going to impact my professional reputation. I haven&#x27;t signed the severance agreement with the release of claims clause yet, but time is running out.<p>What should I do here? Also, for context this is an Idaho company, but I&#x27;ve been splitting my time between Washington and Idaho.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
