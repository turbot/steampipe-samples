Long story short, I (was) a Jr. Dev for about 9 months. I got consistently stellar feedback and enjoyed the job, but ended up putting in my notice for personal reasons.
This was about two months ago. I still enjoy tech and tinker with personal projects, but I accepted a &quot;fun&quot; job outside the tech sphere as the bar manager for a travelling pop-up bar&#x2F;stage show. It has indeed been a lot of fun and I&#x27;ve been to over 10 cities in the past 2 months all across the US. This job is also what&#x27;s bringing me to San Jose.<p>As fun as it&#x27;s been, the nature of the job makes it a temporary arrangement so I&#x27;ll need to re-enter tech eventually and while I have some time in the tech capital of the world I&#x27;d like to see if I can use it to my advantage. I have very little social media presence, no linkedin, facebook, etc so digital networking isn&#x27;t really viable. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to best make use of this time?<p>Thanks in advance!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
