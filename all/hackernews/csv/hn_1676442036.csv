Maybe you own your own business (whichever kind), or doing research in grad school, or some other thing where there is no external force to structure out your day.<p>How do you maintain productivity and get things done? How do you not wander off the internet rabbit hole? I am not talking about toxic patterns like studying 12 hrs a day and live streaming it. I am talking about getting real work done by working in a sane way.<p>Suppose you have taken a year break to prepare for some entrance exam and are self studying subjects on your own. Rather than sitting in front of your books all day and creating anxiety and bad habits (burning out), how do you manage to find time for all things in a healthy way and get things done in every aspect of life?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
