Books can be read in single, or dual language mode. Any language combination is possible.<p>Research shows:
- clear benefits of children that are being read to from an early age. 
- parents should read to their children in the language they are most proficient in, which might be a different language from the one used in 
school, and therefore a language that is harder for them to acquire books in.<p>With BookaBooka I hope to provide all children in the world, including immigrants, expats and refugees with a library in their native tongue, and the privilege of being read to, even if parents aren&#x27;t willing or able.<p>I work with a growing network of language enthusiasts that help me translate &#x2F; narrate our collection.
