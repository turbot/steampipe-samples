34845636,Ask HN: Has anyone hacked together their own ground-penetrating radar?,2023-02-18T10:07:08Z,bcherny,1,false,false,,,,,,"I spent this week at an archaeological excavation, and was surprised by how little technology is used. In particular, it seems like there’s no way to image underground before digging, to see if there’s structures, ceramics, or other artifacts worth digging for. Archaeologists usually stick to taking manual core samples.<p>This is in contrast to surface scanning, where off-the-shelf iPhone LIDAR scanning apps [1] are starting to take off.<p>I researched a bit and found a few off the shelf ground-penetrating radar scanners [2]. But these seem very expensive ($20k+).<p>These scanners seem to operate in the 400-800mhz range, which overlaps with the 802.11ah Wi-Fi range. At the same time, I’ve seen work that uses Wi-Fi to scan through walls [3]. It doesn’t seem too far a leap to repurpose this technology to see through the ground.<p>Has anyone tried hacking together a ground-penetrating radar using Wi-Fi routers, or other off-the-shelf components?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;poly.cam<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;impulseradargpr.com&#x2F;pinpointr&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;fadel&#x2F;wivi&#x2F;",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
34845543,Show HN: Test case generator that combines flowcharts and decision tables,2023-02-18T09:49:26Z,albertizzley,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi, I&#x27;ve been in QA&#x2F;test automation for ~10years.<p>I created a test case generator tool that can generate test cases from combination of flowcharts and decision tables.<p>It works like this: 
1. create flowchart representing logic of a feature you want to generate test cases for. When I was in college we used  a tool called RAPTOR (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raptor.martincarlisle.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raptor.martincarlisle.com&#x2F;</a>) in programming design class and wanted to implement something similar in my tool.<p>2. Flowchart&#x27;s decision (diamonds) and &#x27;process&#x27; (squares) shapes are converted into a decision table<p>3. Once decision table is ready, test cases can be generated based on combination of both: flowchart and decision table.<p>It also comes with a simple test runner- where test cases can be pulled in and then marked as passed&#x2F;failed.<p>It&#x27;s free currently.<p>I think it solves a problem that most QA people and perhaps developers have- inventing and maintaining test cases just takes too long and is a painful process. I aim at making it easier.",story,https://shapest.io,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
