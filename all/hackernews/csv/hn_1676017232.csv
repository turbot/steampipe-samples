34736844,Ask HN: How to use AI to code in a non-degenerative way?,2023-02-10T07:45:37Z,speedping,1,false,false,,,,,,"How to use AI to code in a non-degenerative way?<p>AI coding assist (ChatGPT &#x2F; GitHub Copilot) can do so much with zero thinking on our part. Refactor code, think of architectures, process data, use APIs, etc.<p>This is very degenerative.<p>I want to find a way to use AI to help me speed up coding without it being degenerative to my skills.<p>I have 4 years of full-time experience, so I got a lot of the basics covered, but I still have much to learn.<p>My general rule of thumb is to use it to write code I totally know how to write myself but don&#x27;t want to waste time doing it (like giving it to an intern).<p>If I don&#x27;t know how to do the task, I use it like a senior developer for consultation (without letting it do the task for me).<p>For API usage, I use it like a great search engine for docs (without giving it my specific use case so it doesn&#x27;t hand-feed me exactly what I need).<p>I&#x27;d like to get your feedback on how you use AI in order to speed up coding while still retaining most of the skills &amp; knowledge growth you would have gained without using it.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
