33781174,Show HN: Jektex – Fast server side rendering of latex for Jekyll,2022-11-28T23:07:13Z,yagarea,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello!
This is my first attempt of creating, publishing and maintaining my own package.<p>I have a blog with something around 4000 latex expressions. Client side rendering using latex was super slow and some phones did not render it properly. I tried some KaTeX plugins for server side rendering but they were painfully slow (on my laptop it took more than 5 min to build). So I decided to learn some ruby and create latex rendering plugin by my self. So I created jektex.
Jektex is a Jekyll plugin for fast server side cached LaTeX rendering, with support for macros and is very configurable. Now I can render y entire blog in 2 seconds on same laptop.<p>I will be very happy for any feedback or advice.
Have a nice day",story,https://github.com/yagarea/jektex,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
