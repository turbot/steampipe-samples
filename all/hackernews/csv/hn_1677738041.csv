34992410,Show HN: Live Music Chat and Listening Parties,2023-03-02T05:40:50Z,elecush,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN, Vincent here.<p>Working on a new product, for music lovers and musicians alike.<p>Musicians that are starting out and new bands have a hard time getting exposure.  I have a lot of musician friends and have been contemplating this problem for a few years now.  I just sat down to code this thing up a few days ago, so pardon the rough edges, but the concept is there.  Real-time chat around albums and tracks as a focus.<p>How it works: We have some musicians who love writing words about sound and music, we call them &quot;editors&quot; and they write, manually, not chatGPT, manually, reviews for albums and tracks submitted to our DB.<p>&quot;Well, that doesn&#x27;t scale at all!&quot; you might think.
Yup.  It does not scale.<p>So we are doing pre-sales to help raise funds, to be self-funded as much as possible, and to remunerate our busy editor team for their valuable time.<p>For a paying membership, musicians (and music lovers) get one priority review request per month.  This means your track that you made, or album you made, (or album you love, not necessarily your creation), will get reviewed by one of our editors and added to our Database.<p>Once a track or album is in our database, other paying members can write their own review of it.  If you stop paying your reviews will stay up on the site, but only paying members have access to live chat which is the &quot;listening parties&quot; aspect -- you can navigate to an album page and listen to an album with others, and chat about it if you like.  We have some &quot;ambient presence&quot; features in development, like the music notes you see bubbling across the screen when a user sends a chat message.  You can get a sense of the other people online, and share, in an uncluttered and complementary way, music.<p>I wrote a small post on our website, and our website will eventually point straight to the new app (right now it is the blog&#x2F;wordpress).<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;electricushion.com&#x2F;music-lovers-and-musicians-rejoice-a-new-space-for-both-arriveth&#x2F;<p>At that post you can find the short 3 minute video I recorded to demo the product.  That video can be found directly by going here<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SH7BDFM8_NM<p>And if you are ready to help, there is a stripe checkout link available here.  Special Pre-Sale rate.  I hope it&#x27;s kosher to post it here, if not, we can remove ^.^<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buy.stripe.com&#x2F;28o4hHgM47mh6Ri144<p>Alright, thanks!  As far as feedback goes, uh, pay me if you want to see this thing.  Feedback will be more welcome once the actual product is tangible and you can try it out.  For now, maybe just enjoy the fact that I&#x27;m working on something crazy and different x) Oh and if you also see the potential for how awesome this is going to be, lock in that pre-sale pretty please with treble on top and bass on the bottom.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34992454,Ask HN: Using Apple devices without being signed in iCloud?,2023-03-02T05:49:12Z,trazopene,3,false,false,,,,,,"Does anyone do this? What first made me do it was when my freshly created iCloud on a brand new MacBook was mysteriously “deleted” on their backend despite still being signed in on settings(you need to sign in, to sign out, even if factory reset). Everything was fine at first but then next day..the system was prompting me to enter the password which I was entirely sure is correct (I even wrote it down) but was failing?! Saying my email&#x2F;password was wrong but I was confident it was correct. So my $2400 laptop was essentially bricked. the 1-800 got me a good American English speaking support lady who at first said no such @icloud exists.(I checked and the name was taken for new acts lol) and insisting my password was correct and that I copy pasted it directly, but after pleading she was finally able to dig up my account (good thing I added my phone number when I setup the acc Thank god) and she explained my account was in some disabled state where it looked like accounts that had been manually deleted(which is rare and should never happen automatically within 24h barring extraordinary circumstances) after some hold time, she spoke with “Marketing” who was involved in getting my account reinstated. I immediately turned off Find My, removed Acc from my System, and factory reset. I used my old one instead upon next setup, The next day, attempting to sign in on iCloud.com in browser on a different device yielded a sign in fail message, indicative that my iCloud account was again fucked up. 
So thankfully they saved my laptop but that iCloud account is still inoperable. That was the first time this happened, but not the last. The second was 2 months ago I bought a brand new prepaid iPhone 11, activated, never connected to wifi and, created a fresh iCloud account. Using the same fucking password as always. Everything worked fine for a day, The next morning, same thing. iOS is prompting me to re-login, and it won’t fucking work. It’s failing in the same way as before, like I’m entering an invalid username or password. In iPhones you can override the signed in iCloud password in settings but only if you have a device pin(I didn’t) This time I called the 1-800 again but got a less knowledgeable lady from an overseas call center. and she wouldn’t take my claim seriously that my account was possiblyb“disabled by some internal dept for reasons unknown and probably just thought I forgot my password. I certainly did not. Despite that she directed me to iforgot.apple.com where I filed a forgotten password attempt. I gave them my other phone tel as a contact and they claimed I’d hear back in around 12-15 days(can’t remember exactly) regarding my account recovery. Well that never happened, I never got any text or call from apple. I left the phone alone and after 2 weeks I try again to enter my password and it magically works??!. I never set any new password or had any further correspondence with apple. My account just spontaneously came back to life. If this happened to me twice with devices from major retailers then I wonder how many others it’s happening to - scaring the shit out of them - gaslighting them into thinking they forgot their new password meanwhile leaving their new device iCloud-firm-Bricked.
Tl;dr is you’re signed in with  any iCloud account on iPhone or Mac, if Apple feels like it they can delete your account for mysterious reasons, pulling the rug from under you, as you cannot  sign out &#x2F; reset any device logging in to the iCloud account without first logging in which obviously you can’t log in to a “deleted” account. (the generic message indicating it’s a incorrect user&#x2F;password really adds insult to injury)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
