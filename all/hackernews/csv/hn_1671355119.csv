That&#x27;s what I mean by &#x27;mickey mouse.&#x27;<p>The question has deeper ramifications than it might seem at first glance. The web is now supposed to be humanity&#x27;s repository for knowledge. If a &#x27;song lyrics&#x27; website accepts user-submissions and has lower standards than Wikipedia, the result is a website full of unreliable garbage. Lyrics sites are easy to verify – other more weighty sites may not be.<p>To find and list a song lyric should not be a &#x27;hard problem&#x27;. Lyrics are not secret information – when an artist records a song, someone had better publish those lyrics if they want to safeguard their intellectual property.<p>If the web isn&#x27;t reliable for something as common and popular as song lyrics, maybe it&#x27;s a sign that the business models we have today aren&#x27;t conducive to serious outfits.<p><i>If anyone here is a tech columnist, by the way, maybe this is worth writing about? Is it not a bit strange to have a billion people referring to &#x27;lyrics&#x27; websites that list an entire song accurately perhaps 50% of the time?</i>",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
