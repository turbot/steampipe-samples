Like many grads, it&#x27;s my first full time job in software, which makes it hard to gauge how good or bad the overall experience is compared with other companies.<p>Three years in I <i>think</i> our company is, on average, as good as the best &#x27;out there&#x27;, but when individuals hit rough patches (stress, poor growth, low autonomy, etc.) they often start looking for a new job. Even if they decide to stay put, they sometimes plow on with low morale, berating themselves for not trying a new gig.<p>I believe other good software companies would have just as many problems - though maybe not the same ones as us - and that some of my despairing colleagues would be happier if they had that mindset, focusing on making the most of the opportunities they have and driving change instead of pining for a nirvana. But maybe my expected cosmic background shittiness is too high, I&#x27;m romanticising pointless suffering, and we should actually all bugger off.<p>How can first timers make better judgements about their situations - both in terms of being grateful for what&#x27;s good around them and critical of the genuinely bad?<p>PS:
For those who have been at one company for most of their career, but who felt like quitting for one or more reasons, did things get better or did you just accept the tradeoffs?<p>Have you ever truly regretted quitting a job - why?<p>Money aside, did you ever leave a job you were happy with to find one where you were even more happy?
