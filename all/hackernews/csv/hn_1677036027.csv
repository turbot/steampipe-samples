I dropped out of engineering in the first year, so I have a very basic knowledge of physics.<p>I have an idea (a rather simple one if I need to explain it) that could help solve droughts in some regions, and could also be used to store excess energy from solar PV panels or other forms of non-constant electrical energy production. It&#x27;s not really &quot;new&quot; in the sense of that there is no new specialized technical process (or there might be in some parts, but I don&#x27;t think I could design the technical details - though I thnk it would be based on existing processes).<p>How can I spread this idea in a way that many people know it and attach it to my name, or at least don&#x27;t associate it to some random rich guy? How could I spread it in a way that NO ONE can patent it, take advantage of it by preventing others from using it or charging a lot of money for something that should be used for the good of many? Do I need to make a proof of concept to convince people?<p>Are there science&#x2F;engineering forums that have lots of users where stuff like this can be discussed?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
