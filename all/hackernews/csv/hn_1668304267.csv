What are some strategies for reasoning about this using sound economic principles?<p>Taking a stab at it, based on really nothing. If the number of candidates and opportunities are constant, than the market could absorb everyone fine, but I don&#x27;t think this is the case. I believe that covid created more opportunities, so more opportunities and same amount of workers created a scarcity of workers driving salaries up. With the recession opportunities are shrinking, but workers are staying constant, trigger a return back to pre-covid salaries??<p>Anecdotally, I saw an increase ~25% pre covid to peak covid for my market and role!!
