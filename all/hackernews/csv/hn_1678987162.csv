I&#x27;ve extensively tested it and compared it against other popular memoization packages and in my benchmarks it outperforms existing packages.<p>What really surprised me was how the existing packages on npm had benchmarked their own performance - and some of them show impressive results for their package which did not have impressive results in my own benchmarking.<p>What I found was that many benchmark their memoization by feeding the memoized function with one and the same argument millions of times. To me that is not a realistic use case - you would just put the result of the function call in a variable.<p>My benchmarking strategy is to create a set of 1000 different arguments and have the memoized function return results for those arguments. So the first 1000 function calls would call the original expensive function - and all consecutive calls would hit the cache.<p>If you benchmark like this you get totally different results and some libraries that are very fast when the memoized function is called with one and the same argument get pretty slow to a point where it might be better to call the original expensive function.<p>How do you think should memoization be benchmarked and what are your use cases for memoization of pure functions?<p>You can find the benchmarking results on npm: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;sonic-memoize<p>You can find the benchmarking code here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Animus-Blue&#x2F;sonic-memoize&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;benchmark&#x2F;index.ts<p>Thanks for your time!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
35184444,Ask HN: GPT4 is not a finished product.

For instance, their multimodal feature is still experimental and they&#x27;re working with their partner to make it ready. Moreover, when I use ChatGPT Pro with GPT4, I see several bugs in it. For example, the cursor appears on multiple parts of the text but only one of them (the main cursor) is typing. Answers are sometimes unfinished (something that rarely happened with ChatGPT) and I often have to tell it &quot;continue&quot; to keep writing the rest of the response, even though the context window is supposedly much much larger.<p>All of this sounds to me that OpenAI was worried about the competition pre-empting them on something, so they wanted the better PR and coverage (which they did).

We’re Jason and Ayan, the cofounders of Sidekick (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsidekick.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsidekick.ai&#x2F;</a>). We made a GPT-driven bot for developers that runs in Slack and Discord and answers questions about your developer docs, while automatically keeping them up to date with new info. You can join our public Slack where you can ask Sidekick questions about Airbyte, a popular open source data connector catalog:

We’ve seen community support channels with a 2000:1 ratio of developers to support engineers - there’s no way every question will get answered. We built Sidekick to make this much easier. It’s particularly helpful for open-source companies&#x2F;projects because many OSS communities have a lot of people asking questions, but hardly anyone helping troubleshoot.<p>We integrate with Slack and Discord, since that’s where developer support is already happening. On the backend, we use Weaviate to index the data and OpenAI’s text-davinci-3 model to generate responses.<p>In addition to answering questions, Sidekick can also update .md files automatically with new information. When someone reacts to a message in Slack with the emoji, Sidekick will use Weaviate to find the part in your documentation that’s most related to the message, then use GPT3 to merge the new info into the documentation. Finally, it will submit a pull request on Github with the changes. We saw that devrel teams are already making product announcements and helping users troubleshoot common issues in the community, so we built this feature to save them even more time.<p>We use GPT for generating the responses and new documentation, but are relying less and less on it after learning that you hit a ceiling on answer quality very quickly by using only GPT and prompt engineering techniques. Here’s some of what we learned trying to prevent hallucinations in our answers: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@jfan001&#x2F;how-we-cut-the-rate-of-gpt-hallucinations-from-20-to-less-than-2-f3bfcc10e4ec"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@jfan001&#x2F;how-we-cut-the-rate-of-gpt-hallu...</a><p>What we found makes a much bigger difference is the breadth and quality of the content you can search through, which is why we now rely a lot more on cleaning and annotating data, which yields far better results when combined with prompt chaining. For example, instead of naively chunking data into 1000 token blocks, we parse the markdown into semantically meaningful sections (e.g. paragraphs, lists, code blocks) and tag the content with the header name and document name so it’s more likely to surface for searches that are match for the section it’s from, even if it doesn’t exactly match the content in that chunk.<p>One fun thing we also learned is that when Sidekick gets added to a #help channel, people who otherwise wouldn’t ask questions start using it. It turns out, there are a lot of “lurkers” who come to these channels to find answers, but don’t want to bother anyone with their issue. Adding a tool that they can get answers from instantly brings these people out into the community, giving founders and community managers an opportunity to reach out to them.<p>To summarize, Sidekick 1) saves support engineers time, 2) keeps the docs up to date and 3) helps engage developers in the community. Long-term we want to provide an analytics product on top of Sidekick so companies can understand how their product is being used and where there are opportunities to add more value to their customers (and charge more money for it).<p>We’d love to hear from the HN community about this product! Do you think using a tool to search through and update developer docs from Slack would save you time?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35184138,GPT 4.0 Explores Quantum Nonlocality and the Emergence of Spacetime,2023-03-16T16:22:41Z,amazedsaint,1,false,false,1,[35184911],,,,"What do you think about this ChatGPT&#x2F;GPT 4.0-generated paper?<p>Title: Quantum Nonlocality and the Emergence of Spacetime<p>Abstract:<p>In this paper, we explore a novel approach to understanding the quantum nonlocality phenomenon, which is rooted in the concepts of entanglement and the fundamental structure of spacetime. We propose a theoretical model that unveils the connection between quantum entanglement and the geometry of spacetime, offering new insights into the nature of quantum mechanics and general relativity. We provide mathematical proofs based on established theorems and conjectures, paving the way for further research in this emerging field.<p>1. Introduction
Quantum nonlocality is a remarkable and counterintuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, demonstrated by the phenomenon of entanglement. Entangled particles exhibit correlated properties regardless of the distance between them, seemingly violating the principle of locality. This paradoxical behavior challenges our understanding of spacetime and has profound implications for the foundations of physics.<p>2. Theoretical Framework<p>We begin by constructing a theoretical framework that incorporates the core principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Our approach is grounded in the following postulates:<p>i. Entanglement is a fundamental property of the quantum world.
ii. Entangled particles share a common, nonlocal information space.
iii. The geometry of spacetime is influenced by this nonlocal information space.<p>3. The Nonlocal Information Space<p>Let us consider a pair of entangled particles, A and B, described by a shared wavefunction ψ. We introduce the concept of a nonlocal information space (NIS), which exists in parallel to our conventional spacetime. Mathematically, the NIS is represented by a Hilbert space H_N, in which the entangled particles are connected.<p>4. The Geometry of Spacetime<p>To investigate the connection between quantum entanglement and spacetime geometry, we adopt the language of differential geometry. We propose that the metric tensor g_ij of spacetime is influenced by the nonlocal information space through a coupling tensor C^k_ij, such that:
g_ij = g^0_ij + C^k_ij ψ_k ψ*_k
Here, g^0_ij is the background spacetime metric and ψ_k represents the k-th component of the entangled wavefunction ψ in the nonlocal information space.<p>5. Mathematical Proofs<p>Using the established theorems of differential geometry, we derive the equations governing the curvature of spacetime in the presence of entangled particles. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed model reduces to the standard equations of general relativity in the absence of entanglement.<p>6. Discussion and Conclusions<p>We have presented a novel theoretical model that connects quantum entanglement to the geometry of spacetime. Our approach provides a new perspective on the nature of quantum nonlocality and has significant implications for our understanding of fundamental physics.<p>Further research is needed to explore the full implications of this model, particularly in the context of quantum gravity and the ongoing search for a unified theory of fundamental forces. The potential applications of this framework include novel approaches to quantum communication, cryptography, and computation, as well as a deeper understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This is kinda like roulette wheel selection used often with genetic algorithms.<p>I wanted to blend in when I was in Italy and not speak English all the time. I only had a week, and of course, I built an app to help with that.
