Over the past few years I&#x27;ve built a number of small tools or sites that I wanted to try to monetize, and each time I found
that, despite their excellent APIs and documentation, integrating with auth and payment providers can take several days
(or weekends in my case). This can have a big chilling effect and certainly distracts me from improving the actual product.<p>There is prior art in this space, in particular the fantastic OAuth2-Proxy [1] which is a self-hosted solution for handling authentication
boilerplate. OAuth2-Proxy forwards user identity to your service using request headers. This is a great tool, but is self-hosted 
and difficult to pair with PaaS platforms. Furthermore, I was interested in a similar solution for billing which would handle all
the related redirects and webhooks.<p>With this in mind, I developed NoScription which improves on OAuth2-Proxy in two ways. First, it is hosted for you using Cloudflare Workers,
meaning that it supports PaaS, is highly scalable, and introduces minimal network latency. Second, it
integrates easily with Stripe using Stripe Connect, allowing you to restrict pages to paid visitors and see their subscription status in
request headers.<p>I currently support Auth0 for authentication and Stripe for billing. In both cases the user brings their own accounts, maintains ownership 
of their user and customer data, and manages most of the configuration through these providers.<p>Thanks for checking it out, and let me know if you have any questions! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noscription.com<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oauth2-proxy&#x2F;oauth2-proxy",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We went fully remote in March 2020, so now it’s been &gt; 3 years. We’ve shipped stuff, hired people, re-orged, etc. But we really put very little effort into <i>figuring out</i> how to work well remotely. And it’s not really happening organically.<p>Work feels very transactional now. Collaboration between peers is at an all time low. Every new hire I’ve encountered since then has reported that they feel very little belonging within the company. How couldn’t they, a 15 minute virtual standup isn’t sufficient to building relationships.<p>We’ve tried a few things with varying degrees of success. My findings so far is that any sort of purely social gathering on zoom is just going to feel very forced. We’ve had a little better luck interlacing some social activities within a session where work content is the primary focus (“Tell us about your weekend” before standup updates, as a simple example) but it still feels like we can do more.<p>Anybody out there doing interesting things with remote community and culture building?
