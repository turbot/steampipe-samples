Supaglue is an open source platform to help developers build customer-facing Salesforce integrations into their applications. Use code to define syncs for pulling objects from Salesforce into your application. Embed functional and customizable React components for your customers to configure these syncs.<p>Why?<p>- We built user-facing HubSpot and Salesforce integrations in a previous product we worked on and did not find an existing solution that let us build it quickly, using code, and that supported custom business logic, so we built in-house.<p>- There were some unified API products we evaluated, but they lacked depth, e.g. support for custom fields and objects.<p>- There were UI-based workflow builders, but we did not want to click around in a UI tool to author business logic.<p>- None of the options we evaluated came with ready-to-use React components, nor were they customizable.<p>With our public alpha you can:<p>- On a schedule, sync Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities from Salesforce into your application<p>- Customize where syncs write to (Postgres or an API endpoint), as well as its retry behavior<p>- Author syncs using Typescript<p>- Offload the full OAuth flow and token management to our backend and frontend components<p>- Embed React components for OAuth, field mappings, on&#x2F;off toggles, and manual syncs into your Next.js application<p>- Deploy sync code and monitor sync status using a CLI<p>- Open source MIT license so anyone can self-host<p>We’re very early: we started working on this after the new year and are releasing a public alpha to get early feedback. You can run Supaglue locally using docker compose today. Try it out and send us a note! Website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supaglue.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supaglue.com</a>.

I’d rather fight with my brain than with the tools I use.<p>I wish I could just use an IDE that takes care of all the crap for me and just lets me code and write business logic.<p>I now understand why there’s a trend of developers who want to go live in a farm or take up woodworking: tough(er) problems, but with less variables &amp; easier to reason about. If the wood breaks, you can see where and can probably guess why. Making a table is a mostly linear set of steps, and the basic tools you use don’t change much throughout the years.
