We have designed Spine so that it should be simple to make it LLM-agnostic; we should be able to swap out GPT-3 (the default behaviour right now) for Cohere or an open-source LLM like FLAN or Bloom. We also want to make it trivial to embed Spine in any form -- and are currently working on making an API available so users can embed us on their website or slack.

Akshay is an AI lead at Georgian, where he helps growth-stage companies build ML products and has previously worked at two YC companies. Ashwin is a senior engineer at Instacart with previous experience at Alexa &amp; Aurora (AWS) and NVIDIA. We studied ML together at the University of Waterloo and Nanyang Technological University on an exchange program some years ago.<p>We created Spine in response to the growing demand for incorporating LLM-based chat interfaces into products and services in our companies. Our goal is to make this process as easy and accessible as possible.<p>We&#x27;re still in beta and eager to listen and gather your feedback. To facilitate this, we&#x27;ve prepared three demos that can be accessed without signing up (search through guides for hiring or getting hired remotely, some material from the All-in crew, and a demo on education highlighting some multi-modality). We also have a couple of loom videos if you want to see Spine in Action on the landing page!<p>If you sign up (fingers crossed, everything runs smoothly), you can upload, create, and share as many Spines as you&#x27;d like for free!<p>Please share any feedback or suggestions you may have.

An easy way to minimize these hallucinations is to supply LLMs with external sources of domain-specific data using a vector database.<p>To this end, we built OSSChat, a GPT- and Zilliz-powered  project that you can use to ask questions about, summarize, and analyze open source projects by indexing the documentation and automatically searching for relevant documents when asking a question (these documents are then injected into the LLM as prompt).<p>While we decided to focus on open source projects - Pytorch, Transformers, and Milvus - for now, OSSChat is easily extensible to a variety of other types of data.
