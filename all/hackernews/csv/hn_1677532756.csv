The CTO suggested we use Google Vision, and it was quite easy to use the provided bounding boxes for paragraphs&#x2F;sentences&#x2F;words&#x2F;letters to isolate rows&#x2F;columns. When I revisited my own project after this gig, I threw a lot of my old code away, because Google Vision clever isolation of sections did all the heaviest lifting.<p>I&#x27;m curious to know if anyone else works in this field, what tools you use (e.g. Adobe PDF Extract, Google Document AI, etc), and what types of problems you&#x27;re trying to solve.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
