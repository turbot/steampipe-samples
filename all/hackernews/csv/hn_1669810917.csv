33799324,Ask HN: Am I capable of doing PhD based on my advisor's words?,2022-11-30T11:27:40Z,lavventura,1,false,false,1,[33799684],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I am average student completed my under-grad and grad studies successfully. I am doing PhD since mid 2015 (~7 years now).<p>I was a hard-working student. I was a self-motivated student always wanted to do PhD and stay in Academia. I was hoping somehow my work will help to people.<p>If I compare playing tennis to a PhD studies, I feel like my advisor is breaking my racket to motivate me and I cannot keep up with a broken racket, which is my will to move on.<p>These are the some stuff that my advisor told me multiple times. I cannot forget or over-write them:<p>- &quot;You disappointed and hurt me. I don&#x27;t know what am I going to do with you.&quot;
&#x2F;&#x2F; <i>One year later, during a meeting over zoom, when I told him that these words offended me and I do not want to hurt you anymore, he just closed the zoom meeting to my face saying I am not your psychologist.</i><p>- &quot;You are like a turtle. You can&#x27;t even graduate in 20-30 years.&quot;
- &quot;You are bad at time management and always lost in details.&quot;
- &quot;Your model is junk. I won&#x27;t write my name on top of this model.&quot; 
- &quot;Even high-school students won&#x27;t make the mistakes you do. Should I keep going?&quot; [Me]: &quot;No, please don&#x27;t.&quot; 
- He threw a book at me and told me that: &quot;You should learned from it&quot;
- He keep showing his other students Ph.D. and throw in front of me saying: &quot;See how good they are writing, you should write like them, but I don&#x27;t understand what you write.&quot;
- I have 3 other Ph.D. students, I have to work on their papers, thesis, I have classes to teach. I don&#x27;t time for you. &#x2F;&#x2F; But later, I learn that he was actually working on some other project that he get fund.<p>In front of all the jury members he also mentioned: 
- &quot;I am giving you `F` to motivate you. I trust you keep working.&quot;
- &quot;I never helped that much to any of my student in my life. I don&#x27;t know what I can do more.&quot; 
- &quot;I start to understand the way he thinks and explains his work after 4 years. He is very complex.&quot;
- &quot;Doing Ph.D. is not meant for you, you don&#x27;t have enough capacity for it.&quot;
- &quot;I cannot compile you.&quot; 
- &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that you implemented and tested your code&quot; &#x2F;&#x2F; I have actually done 
- &quot;If I want I can help his journal paper but I will never put a single character on his journal&quot; with a small smile on his face<p>---<p>Everything boiled up when I get `F` from my progress at Fall 2018 on my PhD studies. All lead to depression and anxiety.<p>Then pandemic started in 2019. I have semester multiple semesters and enter into progress again in beginning of 2022 and jury gave me `F` again and threated me that if I don&#x27;t submit my journal paper till next semester they will give me the second `F` and kick me out. Since than, I completely disconnected from my advisor, start to fear from him, but keep working on my journal.<p>I have completed my paper and shared with my advisor 8 months ago, and updated version 2 months ago -- but there is no response from my advisor. When I see him face to face, he keeps saying he was busy and have to work for his other student&#x27;s papers.<p>=&gt; If he allows me to submit my work to a journal; and if I complete my second journal in this semester (~within 4 months) there is a hope that I am approaching to graduation. If I cannot submit my journal in this month I think the everything is over.<p>Overall, I am not blaming my advisor, instead I chose blame myself and think over the following questions: 
- Where did I do wrong? What did I do to deserve all this?
- Why did I start PhD journey? 
- Did I lost most important years of my life for nothing?
- If I have chosen a different advisor, would it be the same?<p><i>All these let me to realize that I am actually not mentally and emotionally capable enough to be successful in PhD or even in any job from now on related to computer science and coding.<p>*=&gt;* Should I conclude that I am not capable enough to do PhD with the words of my advisor? or Should I give myself another chance?</i>",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
