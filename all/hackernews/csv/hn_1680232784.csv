I&#x27;m about 5 months in at the new place and it&#x27;s not been what I was hoping for in pretty much every regard. I&#x27;m a staff-level engineer with about 15 years exp.<p>- Some of the work is in a technical area I don&#x27;t enjoy but kind of circumstantially stumbled into in the last 2-3 years. One of the reasons I left my old team was to try and get away from it but somehow it has landed on my plate once again<p>- My direct manager and the line-level manager are pretty bad. They don&#x27;t  have a view on anything, they&#x27;re pretty detached and don&#x27;t really provide any leadership<p>- The engineering level on the new team is quite a bit lower than my old team. If the other aspects of the job were fine I would just work to raise the level but they aren&#x27;t and so the whole thing just feels like a big downgrade<p>- Because of delayed RSU vest I need to get to about the 1 year mark to break even financially<p>Has any regretted moving jobs before? What did you do?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
