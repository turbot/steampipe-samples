35316721,Lessons Learned from TweetHunter's Million-Dollar Story,2023-03-26T17:03:01Z,wbemaker,1,false,false,,,,,,"Full disclosure, the post below was fully written by my tool Podsqueeze based on my podcast interview with Tibo (founder of TweetHunter, an Indie company that was sold by multiple millions)<p>4 Lessons Learned from Building a Million-Dollar Startup<p>Building a startup froåm scratch is no easy feat, but Tibo, a returning guest on the podcast, managed to grow his startup, Tweet Hunter, to a valuation of multiple millions and eventually sell it to another company. Here are five lessons learned from Tibo&#x27;s journey:<p>1. Partnerships can be game-changers: Tibo&#x27;s partnership with Twitter influencer JK Molina was a major factor in the success of Tweet Hunter. JK Molina brought a lot of value to the company, and Tibo was demanding, expecting him to deliver on his promises.<p>2. A great product and brand are crucial: Tibo emphasized the importance of having a great product with a strong brand. Additionally, replicating their successful Twitter strategy on LinkedIn and having a strong marketing loop helped bring in customers.<p>3. Building a new product can be challenging: After the success of Tweet Hunter, Tibo felt pressure to create something equally successful. The host reassured him that he had the recipe for success and could replicate it by following his intuition and putting aside the pressure to make money.<p>4. Freedom is important: Tibo discussed the stressors of being an indie maker, including lack of money and the pressure to succeed. Having the freedom to work on projects they enjoy can make all the difference.<p>Tibo&#x27;s success story is a testament to the potential of indie companies to become million-dollar businesses that bring a lot of value. So, if you&#x27;re thinking about starting a business, consider these lessons and take inspiration from Tibo&#x27;s journey.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It has client interfaces and boundaries, nontrivial data interactions and usages obscured by the usual C is-it-a-pointer or is-it-an-array, it can be interactively tested using the clients.<p>Anyone taken a swing at ChatGPT for such a thing?<p>This is a class of problem that could really be mutually beneficial between AI and programmer, not the pseudo-adversarial one it currently is. Porting &quot;good code&quot; between languages is a BIG PROBLEM that is holding up good languages.<p>If ChatGPT could enormously speed up standard library conversion authoring and sharing of good algorithms and designs between languages, it could be an enormous boon to the programming language practice.<p>Because that&#x27;s a big pain in the ass that NOBODY wants to do in the large. Sure people might want to play with api designs they have good domain knowledge, but serialization formats for example, or basic api&#x2F;library interfaces? Yuck.<p>And this is a good &quot;bulk charge&quot; money maker. Businesses will flock to this for porting old legacy code and the like.

35316613,Show HN: I built a GPT-4 bot which builds software incrementally,2023-03-26T16:54:29Z,killerstorm,2,false,false,2,[35316761],,,,"The ability to synthesize a relatively short snipped of code was already demonstrated. But I thought it would be interesting to test whether GPT-4 can replace a programmer completely.<p>To do that, AI needs to plan its actions and work on code incrementally, one piece at a time.<p>The challenge is the context size: the entire code base + plan does not fit into the context.<p>My approach: Add only relevant parts of the code base to the context.<p>Specifically, AI generation engine implements two distinct phases: planning and coding.<p>In the planning phase, GPT-4 receives a tree of tasks and a summary of code base (list of files and their descriptions). It replies with updated tasks (i.e. it is able to create sub-tasks as needed), the task it wants to work on in the next step and a list of relevant code fragments for that task.<p>In the coding phase, it receives the task description (as a tree, in YAML) and relevant code fragments. It replies with new generated or updated files, code fragments, and status: Was the task done? Do we need to break it into subtasks?<p>In both cases bot can also show it&#x27;s &quot;observations&quot; before the output, as I believe it helps with planning code generation&#x2F;planning.<p>Results: Currently I have only tested extremely basic scenarios. It needs a lot of work to be usable in practice. But I&#x27;d say it seems to work more-or-less as expected.<p>Example 1: &quot;Write a reddit-like backend in Kotlin, using Ktor. Start by planning and creating subtasks.&quot;<p>This was the entire task which bot received, no other data.<p>Results:<p>Link to output: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;killerstorm&#x2F;dd6e26dc80064b7fc731d583f8d740c1#file-ktor_reddit-txt-L9<p>In short, it formulated reasonably-sounding subtasks and started generating code, e.g. made a Post model. It was aborted at that step due to GPT-4 API failure, it&#x27;s not reliable yet.<p>Example 2: &quot;Write a reddit clone in TypeScript. Start by planning and creating subtasks.&quot;<p>Link to output: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;killerstorm&#x2F;e3c50bea3ca3463c8b2d947dcfd80b84<p>You can see more work here, but I expect that it&#x27;s less interesting.<p>Challenges: I&#x27;d say it can work pretty well in file-at-once mode. Making _fragments_ of the file is more challenging because it&#x27;s not a well-defined concept. FWIW GPT-4 largely ignored what I wrote about file fragments and made entire files at once, which was the right decision.<p>I will post link to script in the comment to this post.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
