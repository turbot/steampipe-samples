33750477,Ask HN: What are some dev jobs with quick feedback loops?,2022-11-26T06:29:09Z,watermelon59,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I’ve realized that over the course of what’s coming up to be a 20 year career, the common theme in almost all my “I need a new job” moments is that I get fed up with how slow the dev loop is. I seem to always find myself in situations where it takes from several minutes up to hours between making a change and being able to see it in action.<p>Some examples: when I worked as a C++ dev doing systems programming, the build time was crazy, plus often having to deploy things to a test system and reboot before being able to test it. As a Java developer building backend services, the build was fast but it took minutes to deploy everything to an environment so I could play with it. As an embedded developer, it took a long time to get everything flashed onto test hardware and having everything set up to debug things. And so on…<p>The one thing I can thing about is front end web dev, but my experience there is limited. I’ve only ever done it in my own time with vanilla js, no frameworks or anything. I was really pleased with how I could just save a file and refresh the browser and voila, changes are instantly available.<p>Wondering if folks can share their experiences having quick dev loops. I feel like it’d be super satisfying to have a job where you get consistently fast feedback as you do your work.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
