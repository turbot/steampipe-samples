34908313,Best Social Media Platforms for Your Redbubble Store,2023-02-23T08:42:29Z,djangonaire,1,false,false,,,,,,"I have been on Redbubble for a very long time and one thing I can certainly say is that driving in traffic is not easy.<p>Why should you have social media presence for your Redbubble store?
More traffic
More sales
Redbubble will increase your reach
The last one is actually true.<p>Many people don’t know this but Redbubble will actually make your designs available to more and more people if you do the marketing.<p>Which social media is best for your Redbubble store?
Instagram — I do it myself. I found a community perfect for my designs.
Pinterest — Many POD sellers do it. I had no success with this.
YouTube — Recently I am following a guy who made $1000 on Redbubble. The designs were so simple. But huge sales. He uploads his products video every day on his YouTube channel.
You can choose any one from above. One thing I am sure of is that I will be sticking to Instagram. Many found success with Pinterest. Now it’s up to you to decide which one you want.<p>If you want to know more about POD business, do join my newsletter The Passive Race. I share weekly tips on POD and many side hustles that I have tested.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
