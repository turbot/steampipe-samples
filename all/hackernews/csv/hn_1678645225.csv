35123366,Ask HN: Why did they break Windows 11?,2023-03-12T17:42:07Z,high_byte,4,false,false,1,[35123744],,,,"Rant &#x2F; I want to ask your experience.<p>There are so many breaking changes to Windows 11, especially to user interface which ruins power user&#x27;s (or any user&#x27;s) experience.<p>Some examples include:
- Alt-Tab does not work like it used to; it&#x27;s worse imo
- Context menu is very different, less accessible
- Folders behave differently
- Task bar cannot &quot;never combine&quot; windows like why the hell would you remove features<p>I see so many breaking changes most of them without a way to revert, or need to go through burning hoops to change. most guides saying to change 10 options in registry often don&#x27;t even work.<p>I miss Windows 7. I will even settle for 10 now...<p>Also I recommend reading this post about UI inconsistencies in Windows 11:
