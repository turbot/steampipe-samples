34845186,Ask HN: 'Stimulant' Drugs/Meds; help needed w.a dead-end I've reached,2023-02-18T08:41:29Z,SaulJLH,1,false,false,,,,,,"Some time ago, I was diagnosed with a number of cognitive issues, one of which is &#x27;addressed&#x27; with a stimulant called Vyvanse.<p>In the 1st year or so it wasn’t a panacea, but it was undoubtedly the single-biggest help to me getting on w.life, &amp; I was doing &quot;all the right things&quot; at that time, not just popping pills! At times, it was truly a godsend&#x2F;revelation, to stick with the religious expressions! ;-P<p>However, for ~2yrs+? now, it&#x27;s felt like it&#x27;s not doing much, if anything, even if I go off it for long periods &amp; then resume, it&#x27;s just not the same?! Once kicked-in, I’m pretty sure it&#x27;s always made me sleepy in the 1st ~2hr, but it feels like that’s #the only thing# left nowadays!<p>Recently, my psychiatrist said; &quot;...It does nothing to address ‘tiredness’ (quite sure that wasn&#x27;t always the case, + nothing like this was said in the early days) &amp; more importantly, I should still feel&#x2F;notice improved clarity-of-thought&#x2F;concentration.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to judge that with a high degree of confidence, but I’m quite sure that was never markedly improved, if at all. I feel the bigger part I got out of it was not focus&#x2F;concentration, but rather; energy&#x2F;drive&#x2F;will, &amp; that’s been mostly-totally absent for ages now!<p>We’ve also tried Concerta a few times, but the feeling each time, was that it wasn’t quite as helpful, so we’d always go back to Vyvanse. She says they’re my only 2 options in Australia, for addressing ADHD-like &amp; executive-function issues.<p>Are there other options, or great resources, that folks can point me to? Mainly interested in ideas for drugs&#x2F;meds, but I’m open to other suggestions. I do address my issues with more than just drugs, but I’m dearly wanting to get that part working effectively again!<p>I have sought the counsel&#x2F;opinion of other psychiatrists, but, they&#x27;re pretty much the same.<p>Man, this was exhausting to type on an ipad pro 12.9 gen.2, whilst sitting on the toilet! &gt;.&gt;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lisdexamfetamine | https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Methylphenidate",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34845314,Ask HN: Play Store has killed my app by not fixing a bug of theirs,2023-02-18T09:08:10Z,arisAlexis,2,false,false,,,,,,"I am unsure what to do, I don&#x27;t usually complain publicly. So I have this app and I managed to get some users interested that want to pay! There is a bug on the subscription screen of Google play which effectively doesn&#x27;t let anyone subscribe. 
I have exchanged 12 emails in 2 months! up to now with Google which basically say this: &quot;Our technical team is working on it&quot;.
As we all know if you get users that can&#x27;t pay and your product is Freemium it can die a slow death and I see people uninstalling after failing to use it. I could increase the usage limit for now I guess.
Has anybody escalated&#x2F;expedited this process successfully?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
