Thought it&#x27;s a connection problem, replaced the SATA cable, same thing. Took the drive out and plug it onto an USB SATA reader, could not get it to read. I only recently (Nov 2022) upgraded to this SSD (from older HDD).<p>So I searched online and it turns out it was a very common problem with the recent WD Blue SA510s. Will not be posting review links for HN but they are straightforwardly found on Amazon and WD website itself, please check them out (and might need to skip the older, very good ratings).<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap SSD drive, or have a recent (2022) version of this drive, be warned! I use steam, store my own mod scripts on github, so didn&#x27;t really lose anything except a good game day, and need to replace the drive. I can&#x27;t imagine how painful it is to lose it with a bunch of work on it.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It takes a community-based approach to annotating and contextualizing misleading tweets, which is a great way for Twitter to enable free speech while combating misinformation and bias. Twitter has shared that Birdwatch uses bridging-based ranking to show notes that are deemed helpful by people who tend to disagree, rather than relying on majority rule or popularity. This increases the likelihood that the added context will benefit a wider audience.<p>I&#x27;m curious about other use cases outside of Twitter that could benefit from a Birdwatch-like solution using bridging-based ranking. What comes to mind?<p>More on Birdwatch here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communitynotes.twitter.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;en",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
