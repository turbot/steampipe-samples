The search app on Froyo and earlier (maybe even till ICS, I don&#x27;t remember) was able to display information from all Content Providers on a device.
Now the Google app only display Web results it does not even display contacts. 
That was one of the best features of Android, IMHO.
Google still say search is &quot;at the core of android&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;develop&#x2F;ui&#x2F;views&#x2F;search)
