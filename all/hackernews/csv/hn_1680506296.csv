35419407,Ask HN: WWYD? Built a company valued at $1B and may walk away with nothing,2023-04-03T06:40:59Z,susanwise,3,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;m looking for some &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; advice from the founder and investor community. Generally looking for guidance on what I should be negotiating for and what type of downside protection is fair, in any?<p>Financial Overview<p>- At our peak (Series C) we were valued at $1B post money - $187M raised by the company 
- $250M preference stack (liquidation prefs + debt)
- I own ~27% of the business, and so does my co-founder. My co-founder is no longer part of the business day-to-day, he&#x27;s on the board
- We will end the year at $130M in annual revenues and burning ~$925K&#x2F;month, we are a low gross profit margin business ~15-20%<p>Personal Overview 
- I live in New York City, it&#x27;s been ~ 10 years that I have been on this journey, bootstrapped with no salary for about 2.5 years and pretty modest salary for most of the years, up until a couple years ago when I started getting &quot;market rate&quot;
- I have not taken any chips off the table via any secondary sale up to this point, never really got the chance 
- Today, my base salary is $175K, no bonus, no stock refresh since the founder grant, fully vested stock, no severance, no  indemnification. (Mainly because I just haven&#x27;t asked for new comp b.c company is in a difficult spot)
- In comparison, I hired a critical new C-Suite exec (COO) and gave her $285K&#x2F;year, 75-150% annual target bonus, $150K sign on bonus, $200K funding closed bonus, 1-year severance, and a 4% equity stake in the business
- I am starting to see some worrying signs of real burnout now (for myself)<p>State of the Union
- We have &lt; 6 months of runway based on our current burn, but majority of the money left is debt now
- I am about to close on $30M of additional financing this month but the terms will decimate common stock holders (my 27% stake is likely going to go down to &lt; 10%) 
- Still negotiating, but will likely have to give up board control so I could get fired immediately after financing is closed
- We are in parallel exploring strategic M&amp;A alternatives this year, but in the current market condition our business is likely worth less than the preference stack, in which case common stock is wiped out anyways and I get nothing.
- Lastly, I&#x27;m not confident on the current strategy to grow out of the current problem over the next couple years, so there&#x27;s a lot of risk in our growth for 2024 and beyond. The strategy I would want to run as CEO is likely not something my COO or board will want to get behind and frankly I don&#x27;t know if I have the energy to do it myself. It would require 24-36 months to transition the business to the new world while watching old revenue decline and waiting for new higher margin revenue build up in parallel to offset the declining revenues in the core business.<p>My #1 priority is to get the financing closed for the business. But from there, I&#x27;m really confused and don&#x27;t know what to do next. Doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense for me to work my ass off just to return money to investors and have nothing for myself. But I do understand that it is my fiduciary obligation as the Founder&#x2F;CEO, but maybe for the first time in 10 years I&#x27;m asking the question &quot;What&#x27;s in it for me?&quot;<p>WWYD?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35419283,Ask HN: Why do students have a hard time understanding pointer arithmetic?,2023-04-03T06:25:10Z,noob_eng,2,false,false,1,[35419693],,,,"We often hear that C is not a good language to get started in programming. Most schools have moved onto Python to teach their introduction to programming course. Apart from safety and security issues, the most cited reason for not preferring C as a first language is the fear of pointers and its arithmetic.<p>Why is it so?<p>Is it because previously CS departments were tied up with Electrical departments and the students took an architecture of digital logic&#x2F;electronics course where they were aware of the hardware?<p>With the separation of CS and Electrical the study of the entire stack (from hardware to software) was abandoned and students have no idea what is happening at the machine level. They start programming at the high level (Python) and everything is very watered down. When they go on to learn languages like C they can&#x27;t relate with the memory addresses and their arithmetic (pointers are basically syntax for memory addressing and management) because they don&#x27;t know how the electronics operate.<p>This separation is becoming more and more prominent.<p>Also there is a aversion towards building something from scratch. The urge is to use a library that implements it. I mean, that is fine. But to really understand something it is best to implement it from scratch. First gen hackers and great programmers had to build everything from scratch even GUI frameworks were not available. We rarely see mastery of that sort nowadays. Everything is becoming too superficial.<p>And then there is functional programming. Racket&#x27;s founders have a nice book <i>How to Design Programs</i> to teach beginners how to learn good coding. I mean it&#x27;s great. It enforces good code, tests, no mutation to get rid of errors as much as possible. But the thing is to make functional programming languages efficient someone has to implement one level below the compilers&#x2F;interpreters in such a way where pointer and efficient management of memory is unavoidable i.e. all the dirty work needed to make the beautiful land of functional programming. Don&#x27;t we need to know how the languages work efficiently under the hood? Where do we get those engineers who create the happy land of functional programming one level above where users can do clean and neat programming? How do we debug under the hood with functional languages?<p>Memory is cheap. That doesn&#x27;t mean we write sloppy non-efficient code and further overuse energy? Why are we so shy of space efficient programs? Just for the sake of correctness assurance?<p>Maybe, we are using abstraction the wrong way. It is the same case with math. Math education is getting dumbed down and the abstractions are increasing.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
