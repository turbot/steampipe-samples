I hope you&#x27;re doing well today! I wanted to share something with you. Recently I was on the hunt for the best way to journal daily. Well, I had this idea - what if I could feed all my daily entries to an AI (ChatGPT), and create a friendly, supportive character like Socrates or Simon Sinek? This way, I could ask any questions about my life and mental health, and get some amazing advice on how to improve myself!
The results have been absolutely mind-blowing ! I even made a short GIF to show you how it works - check it out! - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gifyu.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;SdHLH<p>I&#x27;ve shared this with my friends, and they loved it so much that they&#x27;ve been asking me to create a full-featured journalling app with an AI assistant! What do you think? Would you be interested in using an app like this?<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and thoughts on this. Please feel free to drop a comment and let me know what you think! Right now, I&#x27;m just collecting a waitlist of people who are interested in the app, so if you&#x27;re interested, here is a link for signup to waitlist - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tryscrapbook.com&#x2F;  .If I can get 100 people on the waitlist in the next few days, I&#x27;ll launch the app!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
