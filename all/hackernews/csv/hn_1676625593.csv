34832374,Ask HN: Dealing with people having “Computer Problem”?,2023-02-17T08:48:30Z,scantis,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi,
I&#x27;m sadly somewhat responsible for IT related problems in a small part of our organization. Sometimes the staff calls me out of nowhere to solve some &quot;Computer Problem&quot;. Everytime this happens I feel a chill in my bones and imagine serious horrors, since most of them are engineers, Linux freaks and scientists. I thought they operate beyond my abilities. 
So far I had, inability to change cartridge of a printer, inability to check box for duplex, montior not connected, inability to press a mouse button switching scrolling from flywheel to gear, somebody jamming USB type B into RJ 45 socket, inability to connect to NAS by forgetting use of VPN and using RDP on RDP on RDP and getting confused where the data is.<p>I should be thankful that I can solve these problems easily, but they don&#x27;t like it. These people then try to appear smart by talking about something complex. Because I&#x27;m in problem solving mode I used to give it my 2 cents. They then quickly use sophisticated words and sometimes throw in abbreviations, which is an obvious sign somebody has no clue and wants to talk you down. When I use descriptive terms and fully speak out the abbreviations, it gets worse. They are quickly annoyed, even though I stopped what I was doing to help them.   
They need to appear smart, after those embarrassing moments, I get this. I stopped giving my 2 limited cents and just try to acknowledge them somehow, but it is difficult for me to sound sincere. I think it makes it worse. Should one only ask questions and try to flee the scene as fast as possible?<p>It is the most difficult part of the &quot;Computer Problem&quot; and I honestly suck at it.<p>I just want to be helpful. How do you manage this? What is a good strategy here?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

1. Reverse engineering the Twitter and Instagram APIs to make production-ready social media bots - we find and map all the HTTP endpoints for Twitter and Instagram. Capstone project is a bot that leaves the FIRST comment whenever a celebrity posts on IG or Twitter 
2. Learn the FFMPEG C api - we go through FFMPEG data structures, translate command line prompts into C code, navigate the large documentation and build a video decoder and encoder in C",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
