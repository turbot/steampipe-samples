We&#x27;ve been using it with my friends for a while, and we had a few laughs here and there.

I have always wondered about a real innovation in the provider patient relationship. Of course, this is only the case for the treatment phase, not the diagnosis as the individual is the primary focus for the provider. In spin class and yoga, one provider (instructor) can provide high value for many. Is there any way this has been taken advantage of that anyone knows of? I would love to do something in this space. I am aware of many of the constraints like the one I mentioned (cannot diagnose many as each case might be unique) and health info being private. But there must be many applications that could shorten wait times for treatment, or bring the costs down for patients or both. The main insight being that many things that healthcare providers do are repeatable and generic for many patients. The closest that comes to mind is group therapy. Surely this line of thinking could unpack the value of healthcare providers? Any criticism&#x2F; examples&#x2F; companies doing things in this space would be appreciated.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
35062287,Managing Your Users OpenAI Token Usage,2023-03-07T22:36:52Z,homar,3,false,false,2,[35062378],,,,"Hi,<p>I am currently developing a tool that tracks and invoices users for their OpenAI token usage on behalf of developers who release their fine-tuned&#x2F;embedded GPT models. If a model ends up being shared widely, developers will have to deal with an unexpectedly large bill. This is why many developers who share their models ask users for their OpenAI API Key which can be confusing for non-technical people as well as breach OpenAI’s terms of service. With this tool, this risk is mitigated and developers can share their models without worrying about incurring a large OpenAI bill or asking users for their API Keys. At the end of every month, developers are paid what they are owed based on user’s usage of their model.<p>For users of the models, they don’t need to sign up until they finish their $5 in credits so their experience will be the same.<p>Currently, I am seeking beta users to test the tool. If you are interested in trying it out, please sign up for the waitlist below.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modeltune.co<p>Let me know if you have any feedback.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
