35162524,Ask HN: I'm depressed because my ideas suck. Why am I so stupid?,2023-03-15T01:36:30Z,my_ideas_suck,1,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;ve been trying to enter the entrepreneurship game for about a year or two but I seem to be hitting roadblocks at each step.<p>I feel like my pitch are just terrible, because everyone I&#x27;ve pitched my ideas to says that they&#x27;re too difficult&#x2F;risky or cannot be done because it works X way right now and its too hard to compete with some of the players in the space.<p>Maybe I am naive but I&#x27;ve been trying to approach problems I have in my own life, seeing if others have these same experiences, and then trying to break down the problem into the smallest atomic bits so I can then figure out a &quot;better way&quot; in my mind. Side stepping a lot of the existing players by trying different things.<p>However, it seems that the people I want feedback or investment from aren&#x27;t willing to entertain alternative ways to do something. I feel like in many cases, the reason innovation is difficult or hard to do is because people try to go after the small gaps in the process, but eventually that leads to more gaps because they&#x27;re just patching solutions in place. I don&#x27;t see the point in patches upon patches, it just means the whole thing is inefficient and sucks.<p>Sometimes, isn&#x27;t it better to re-imagine a way to do something? Its not like I&#x27;m just coming up with ideas fresh off a mushroom trip. I&#x27;ve talked to people and come up with figures that are realistic and seem possible.<p>Maybe its hard to do X today because of many entrenched players in the space who have walled gardens. Okay. But if we have a problem in mind, and we break down the problem into as many sub-problems as possible, we can find a way around these entrenched players who are too busy defending their rathole.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve only ever worked at bigger companies. At my previous job we were doing something the same way for almost 10 years (patches upon patches) to the point that customers were not interested in that feature and the company was fine letting it stagnate. I thought that if we could re-build that feature using off the shelf solutions to begin with, we could generate so many tie-ins into our existing product. Thankfully my manager believed in me and let me build a proof of concept, which was then demo&#x27;ed to higher ups in product and we ended up going all in. Today, that thing generates millions of dollars (100s I think) and brings a ton of value to customers and the business. But for almost 10 years, nobody cared or thought of doing it in a way that would actually work and fulfill its true potential.<p>I know I am naive but I can&#x27;t help but think that people just don&#x27;t want to think outside the box. I&#x27;ve encountered this in my career and now I&#x27;m encountering it in the entrepreneurship world. What am I doing wrong? Why am I so dumb to think I can just take something apart to its smallest bits and put it together in a better way?<p>Please help me because otherwise I&#x27;m just going to quit and go work at USPS or something like that and never think to innovate again. I feel so depressed and defeated.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35162242,Ask HN: What Happens When AI Is Emailing with AI?,2023-03-15T01:05:55Z,devstein,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN<p>Over the past few months, there have been countless GPT-powered products released in the past few months that help you automate personalized emails to thousands of unsuspecting recipients. Yet no one is talking about the people on the receiving end of those emails.<p>What happens when those recipients have AI email assistants responding to those AI-generated messages? I&#x27;m curious what people think this end state will look like. Some questions on my mind.<p>- Do the AI-assistants know their respective parties goals and only reach out to the human when necessary?<p>- Will email providers hide AI-to-AI conversations and only surface the end-state?<p>- Will there be regulatory disclosures required &quot;this email is generated by AI&quot; similar to requiring unsubscribe links on mailing lists?<p>- Will there be a single dominant AI assistant for all types of emails? Or specialized assistants for different types of emails (sales, recruiting, events, other solicitations)?<p>- Does the way we interact with email itself change? Does your inbox become more like a messaging app with different AI bots, similar to Slack or Discord?<p>- Does emailing become extremely terse and action oriented? i.e instead of an thank you email, you received a notification in your inbox saying &quot;Sarah thank you for X&quot;<p>What do you all think?<p>Disclosure:<p>My curiosity comes from actively working on a project in this problem space for recruiting, called SRC (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharedrecruiting.co). SRC goal is to promote transparent, collaborative communication by narrowing the tooling gap between candidates and companies. For candidates, this is an AI-powered career assistant in their inbox. For companies, it&#x27;s an AI-powered sourcing sidekick. If this idea resonates, join the waitlist or reach out to me at devin at sharedrecruiting.co :)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
