And they don&#x27;t take it as a disruption, which changes schemes.
Because they really wouldn&#x27;t even know about it. Being a subject that nobody has ever really dealt with.
But the concept it&#x27;s a simple sum, then keep going to increase the phenomenal interaction. 
Let me make a simple caparison: One Turn is One step, OK, Well in this particular case. 
When you do One Turn is One Step, And Then is another turn are gone to be Two Steps.
And in the next turn are gone to be Four steps, And the next Turn are gone to be 8 Steps. Etc...
Really to to be able to explain it, needs to invent a new Mathematical Signal. Brand New.
I Tell You. Its Like That.<p>*<p>I&#x27;m going to explain them perfectly well. We are going to make a comparison that each turn of the Rotor (applied in my case&#x2F;Gearturbine) is a Step. It&#x27;s fine. And So now when the rotor rotates with the power of the mechanical drive (Action). And furthermore, it has the internal flow contrary to its rotation (Reaction), but in favor of the individual blade attached to the gear with planetary rotation that activates the Rotor. In such a case they are two forces in a single system.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;ve used it pretty much since the start from ~2016 (back when Angular was cargo-culting it like mad). I&#x27;ve always had generally negative experiences with it:<p>1) Messy Javascript API resulting in inexpressive storybook files, particularly for big frameworks like Angular and big components.<p>2) Slow AF with webpack&#x2F;terser&#x2F;etc. And that&#x27;s before you start bolting on crazy addons like compodoc.<p>3) Tries to solve so many different problems (just a subjective opinion of mine).<p>4) Insane levels of &quot;framework magic&quot;, particularly when I&#x27;ve used it with Angular, but also in other scenarios too.<p>---<p>So, I wanted to ask HN to gauge the appetite for a similar but not same kind of Storybook:<p>1) Extremely expressive Javascript API. Think Jest.<p>2) Go CLI (allowing direct interface with ESBuild, etc.).<p>3) ESBuild-centric (rather than webpack, or worse, addons [1]).<p>4) Typescript-centric (rather than seeming like an after-thought).<p>5) Much less framework magic (think React, Redux, etc. Stick mostly to simple explicit JS behaviors).<p>6) Probably a lot more that haven&#x27;t come to mind yet.<p>Before I go any further with it, it would be amazing to hear what you guys think about all of this. What are your thoughts about Storybook? Too much tech debt for them to modernize? Am I just being silly and picky about Storybook? Am I the crazy one?<p>I just think it would be amazing to have a frontend workshop app with the speed of esbuild, the expressiveness of jest and cypress, the elegance of React.<p>Thanks HN!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storybook.js.org&#x2F;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storybook.js.org&#x2F;addons&#x2F;storybook-addon-turbo-build",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
