An MVP would be:
- user submits a prompt and an art style
- pre-trained model responds with AI artwork
- user selects an artwork
- size, colour, add to cart, checkout
- use printing service and API to dropship the shirt
This type of MVP should only take 60-100 hours to build depending on how tuned the model is towards generating good looking tees. What are your thoughts?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
