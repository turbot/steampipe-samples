35112310,75% of USDC is backed by US Treasury Bonds (Good News),2023-03-11T20:25:15Z,louison11,4,false,false,2,[35112413],,,,"TLDR; 75% of the US dollars backing UDSC are held in US Treasury Bonds (virtually safest asset on the planet). The downside is thus very limited.<p>There is a lot of FUD right now. But Circle (company responsible for the peg USDC &lt;&gt; USD) is actually very transparent and the data is independently audited every month (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.circle.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;transparency):<p>Last month, Circle had $43.4B in assets.
They&#x27;ve announced that $3.3B is exposed to SVB: that&#x27;s approximately 7.6% of their assets (unclear how much they have right now, but it&#x27;s in that horizon).
In January, a total of $11.1B was held at banks (SVB+others). Everything else ($32.4B or approximately 75% of assets) is held in a fund as US Treasury Bonds. 75% of Circle&#x27;s assets are thus basically insured by the US itself.<p>Meaning that even if SVB were to give nothing back of the $3.3B it owes to Circle (unlikely, they&#x27;d at least get <i>some of it</i> back), the loss would be limited at around 7.6%. In the even less likely case of a total collapse of <i>all</i> the banks they&#x27;re using, about 1&#x2F;4 at most would be lost to the banks.<p>This isn&#x27;t a Terra make over. Very different situation. This is a well structured company with lots of due diligence and auditing proving the safety of the assets. Chill out, everything&#x27;s gonna be alright.<p>Disclaimer: not financial advice. I&#x27;m just a normal guy who can open a PDF and read the data.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
