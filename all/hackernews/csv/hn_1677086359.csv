34898253,Launch HN: Depot (YC W23) – Fast Docker Builds in the Cloud,2023-02-22T16:40:15Z,jacobwg,35,false,false,8,"[34898891,34898805,34898405,34898476,34898869,34898649]",,,,"Hey HN! We’re Kyle and Jacob, the founders of Depot (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;depot.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;depot.dev</a>), a hosted container build service that builds Docker images up to 20x faster than existing CI providers. We run fully managed Intel and Arm builders in AWS, accessible directly from CI and from your terminal.<p>Building Docker images in CI today is slow. CI runners are ephemeral, so they must save and load the cache for every build. They have constrained resources, with limited CPUs, memory, and disk space. And they do not support native Arm or multi-platform container builds, and instead require emulation.<p>Over 4 years of working together, we spent countless hours optimizing and reoptimizing Dockerfiles, managing layer caching in CI, and maintaining custom runners for multi-platform images. We were working around the limitation of multi-platform builds inside of GitHub Actions via QEMU emulation when we thought &quot;wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if someone just offered both an Intel and Arm builder for Docker images without having to run all that infrastructure ourselves&quot;. Around January of 2022 we started working on Depot, designed as the service we wished we could use ourselves.<p>Depot provides managed VMs running BuildKit, the backing build engine for Docker. Each VM includes 16 CPUs, 32GB of memory, and a persistent 50GB SSD cache disk that is automatically available across builds—no saving or loading of layer cache over the network. We launch both native Intel and native Arm machines inside of AWS.
This combination of native CPUs, fast networks, and persistent disks significantly lowers build time — we’ve seen speedups ranging from 2x all the way to 20x. We have customers with builds that took three hours before that now take less than ten minutes.<p>We believe that today we are the fastest hosted build service for Docker images, and the only hosted build service offering the ability to natively build multi-platform Docker images without emulation.<p>We did a Show HN last September: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33011072"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33011072</a>. Since then, we have added the ability to use Depot in your own AWS account; added support for Buildx bake; increased supported build parallelism; launched an eu-central-1 region; switched to a new mTLS backend for better build performance; simplified pricing and added a free tier; and got accepted into YC W23!<p>Depot is a drop-in replacement for `docker buildx build`, so anywhere you are running `docker build` today, you replace it with `depot build` and get faster builds. Our CLI is wrapping the Buildx library, so any parameters you pass to your Docker builds today are fully compatible with Depot. We also have a number of integrations that match Docker integrations inside of CI providers like GitHub Actions.<p>We’re soon launching a public API to programmatically build Docker images for companies that need to securely build Docker images on behalf of their customers.<p>You can sign up at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;depot.dev&#x2F;sign-up"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;depot.dev&#x2F;sign-up</a>, and we have a free tier of 60 build minutes per month.

The project is still in its early stages, so I only have a few of the plugins I want, but it&#x27;s already beneficial to switch out the Git LFS black blob for S3&#x2F;Cloud Storage.<p>I drew inspiration from two excellent projects - giftless and truss - for the project&#x27;s architecture. Both taught me a lot, and I wanted to build something similar to giftless but contained in an image so that I could more easily move around, test and deploy to different cloud backends without worrying about managing dependencies.<p>I split the codebase into a plugin architecture that allows you to specify which backends and manipulations to add to a configuration file. Additionally, I had to figure out how to handle secrets better. I opted for a source-drain technique where the config specifies the secret&#x27;s source, such as Vault or an environment variable, which is then funneled into a &quot;drain&quot; (e.g., a hidden folder mounted on the Docker container). Could this approach be safer than using env vars? I also worked on some deployers and got the ECR upload working, which sends the Docker image to the registry for later deployment on App Runner.<p>While working on this project, I realized I had inadvertently built a Docker wrapper that could work for any Python API. This wrapper abstracts away Docker, secret management, plugins, and deployment, among others. I could run the build-context command and switch out the API file for whatever I wanted. I&#x27;m considering spinning that part out to make it a more API-agnostic tool.<p>Let me know if you have any questions or feedback. I&#x27;d be happy to discuss this further.",story,https://github.com/NishanthSingaraju/gitlink,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34898504,Show HN: Canvas Language Animations – Add little animations to pictures,2023-02-22T16:54:56Z,sclerek,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on Canvas Language (SCL) for over 10 years, mostly as a side project. A few years ago I launched <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;EditableGIFs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;EditableGIFs.com</a> (EG) using SCL to program the animations and let users easily customize the gifs.<p>Last week I was making a little promo video for EG using Flickify. I couldn&#x27;t find a way to add an animation over an image so I went back to one of my old SCL projects, made some changes, and now there is this studio <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canvaslanguage.com&#x2F;studio"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canvaslanguage.com&#x2F;studio</a>
The purpose of this studio is to add little animations to pictures, then download the animations as little videos for incorporation into larger productions.
In the help section of the studio (examples), there is a link to a video where I used 4 of the animations templates (pointer, falling arrows, opening curtains, and horizontal slideshow). Editable language code is under the Advanced tab.<p>Trouble is, I&#x27;m not sure that there is a market for this (adding animations to pictures). I know there is Canva and Adobe, etc, but I can make arguments to why this is a nice alternative. So I&#x27;m just wondering, is it worth making a dedicated site out of this?<p>Would love your feedback on the studio, but maybe even on SCL in general as I hope to expand it to more niches.<p>Thank you.",story,https://canvaslanguage.com/studio,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
