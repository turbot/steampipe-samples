I haven&#x27;t taught it to use itself yet if a module isn&#x27;t installed, but that&#x27;s next on the agenda once GPT4 isn&#x27;t so slow.<p>Video intro here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZK8fUuQDgZ4"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZK8fUuQDgZ4</a><p>Fun experiment: I fed it some of the &#x27;tests&#x27; for other simple Python based modules and it was pretty good at implementing what was needed to succeed at them by replacing their module name with `doom.`. Obviously lots it can&#x27;t do, but it&#x27;s already surprisingly reliable.<p>You&#x27;ll need a GPT4 API key-- it works with ChatGPT 3.5 turbo but that code is a little less reliable (and it can&#x27;t generate as lengthy code).<p>It has two modes-- the ridiculous &#x27;global&#x27; cataclysm mode for use in notebooks&#x2F;interpreter that lets you hand-wave any function name and it&#x27;ll cook it up for you. This is a bit scary (a typo turns into random code execution), so the second mode is just to use &#x27;doom.&#x27; in front of any function name and it&#x27;ll generate&#x2F;cache its best guess for the right code given where it&#x27;s called in the call stack (and its name&#x2F;types&#x2F;parameter names&#x2F;etc).<p>A bit extreme, but a small concept to help us adjust to the impending cataclysm ahead of us. :)",story,https://github.com/Mattie/cataclysm,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
