I always felt that GPT tends to err towards current best practices, and struggles when explictly asked to innovate. Imagine if it existed in the 90&#x27;s and we all wrote elaborate OOP hierarchies and CORBA services because that is all the programming knowledge GPT was trained on. Of course, probably &gt;90% of work contains no new ideas, but even so many people come up with clever little hacks that can spread to others surprisingly well.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
