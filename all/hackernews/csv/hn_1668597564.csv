33621030,Show HN: A simple way to get a better job,2022-11-16T10:26:48Z,Vaidas_sbtm,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I‘m working on an education technology startup which allows users to do everything in terms of teaching and learning: any kind of content, private or public programs, paid or free, embed and etc.
But along with these features, I realised that this tool can help to get a better job in a simple way.
Every employer strives to have the best candidate and always looks for something special among nearly equal resumes (CV).
Let‘s imagine that your resume has a chapter Other activity - building my own academy to help younger professionals (and link to the profile).
Will it hook your employer? I guess so.
Another trick. The platform allows setting a password to access your content. So, if you urgently looking for a job you can create only titles, and chapters without content inside (no one will judge you for being in the process).
Public access to demo profile is here:
If you want to look inside you can use login:

I&#x27;m experimenting with writing something from scratch (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.org) but am also interested to see what&#x27;s out there that might be otherwise used.<p>The thing that Mastodon is highlighting is this move of communities to their own platforms that might be interconnected rather than just one giant centralised server governed by a corporation. I think from an end user perspective this isn&#x27;t going to be vitally important but because mostly technologists drive bottom up trends it might become more prevalent. Email is always the thing to point to.
