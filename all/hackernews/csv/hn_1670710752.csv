Some think anything having to do with Google violates your privacy and is part of an &quot;evil&quot; advertising economy.  Some find videos on YouTube to be obnoxious vacuous content the way I find image memes on Reddit are.  Another is &quot;why are you making me watch a 45 minute video to see a point that I could read in 45 seconds in writing?&quot;<p>What I find most remarkable is that many people find the links don&#x27;t work for them.  I think that is because a lot of content with clearly identifiable copyright (say a music video or the intro of a television show) is identified by Google,  which has a deal with the copyright holders to pay them advertising revenue for viewers in some geographies (like the U.S.) and block the video in other geographies.<p>One could make the case that a lot of that stuff is trivial but I still think there are independent Youtubers such as Techmoan, Technology Connections, and Anna Psychology that could be of interest to the HN community.<p>What are your thoughts?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
