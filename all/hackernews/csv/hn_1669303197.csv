I’m the founder of Confluo app, a personal task assistant for both individuals and teams as well as for both personal and professional projects or activities. Since its launch three months ago, I’ve significantly revamped confluo.<p>Below is a list of what has changed: 
  · Confluo now supports connecting, collaborating and coworking, all for free.
  · You can now invite and connect with your friends and colleagues.
  · Collaborate on one common activity or project with a team of up to 10 people under the free plan.
  · Virtually co-work with your friends and followers on as many activities or projects as you want.<p>A little background:
The fact that we usually feel more productive working in environments, such as libraries, coworking spaces, or cafés, where we feel that others around us are also working really became apparent to me during the covid lockdowns when I witnessed workers, students and writers using a variety of virtual coworking methods to study or work together, such as, via Zoom sessions, forming study groups and channels on Discord, or using Focusmate.<p>Even though lockdowns are behind us (I hope), some of those virtual sessions are continuing to this day. But I always felt the requirement of keeping the camera ON to attend these sessions a bit intrusive and found them unsuitable for carrying out non-sedentary tasks such as gym or sport. Even for sedentary tasks joining video sessions has been getting increasingly impractical now that most of us are working from anywhere rather than home.<p>Hence, I initially conceived Confluo as my personal task assistant that would organise my tasks and share my task highlight with my friends as I work through a task as a way for me to feel committed without having to turn my camera ON.<p>Since then, I have also been experimenting with other task management apps but found them to fall short on one or all of the following things:
  · Ability to quickly create an event in calendar from a task
  · Focus sessions with Pomodoro break reminders for longer sessions
  · Ability to track my work hours and accumulate my skills
  · Notify me when an event ends and suggest which tasks, I might pick next<p>With Confluo I believe I have addressed all the above points. But like any other products Confluo is a work in progress. Currently, I&#x27;m working on enabling collaboration on more than 1 activity&#x2F;project is not supported as I haven&#x27;t worked out a paid plan yet.<p>Please give it a try and provide your feedback. I hope you’d find it helpful.",story,https://www.confluo.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
