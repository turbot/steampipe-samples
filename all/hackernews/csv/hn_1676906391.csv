34868822,Ask HN: Do I Need a PhD?,2023-02-20T15:13:25Z,throwaway_am,3,false,false,1,[34868894],,,,"Hello *<p>I&#x27;m a Physicist with more than 6 years of experience in Data Science&#x2F;Machine Learning in industrial&#x2F;business environments. I like my job, but sometimes I miss the old days when I was doing research during my master&#x27;s degree. Therefore, I&#x27;ve started applying to private companies that do ML research (OpenAI, Meta, DeepMind, NVIDIA, etc.). However, even if not asked explicitly, it seems impossible to be accepted in any of these companies without a PhD in a relevant field. My CV is not bad -I would say above average- but I never did a PhD.<p>The point is that recently, I received an opportunity to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning&#x2F;Deep Learning, and now I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a good move to accept the opportunity and leave my current job. While I&#x27;m not interested in an academic career in university (I don&#x27;t see myself moving from one university to another for the rest of my life), it seems that a PhD is necessary to work in ML research.<p>What do you recommend? Should I leave my current job and take the risk of pursuing a PhD, or should I continue to apply to these companies and wait for an opportunity to arise?<p>Thanks for your help!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34868771,Show HN: Whisper.cpp and YAKE to Analyse Voice Reflections [iOS],2023-02-20T15:08:43Z,ArminRS,2,false,false,,,,,,"Six months ago, I went full-time indie, but I haven&#x27;t released anything so far. The products just never felt good enough for me to publicly say this is what I&#x27;m doing now.<p>To get out of this mindset, I decided to make an app for myself in a week, add monetization, release it and move on. The app idea was simple: Reflect on your day by answering the same four questions out loud. The answers are transcribed and with regular use you can see what influences you the most and take action. All on-device, as otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable sharing my thoughts.<p>I had all core features working within a day by simply modifying an existing example app. However I was dissatisfied with iOS&#x27;s built-in offline transcription due to a lack of punctuation and the speech recognition permission prompt that made it seem like data would leave the device. Decided to use whisper.cpp [0] (small model) instead. This change, lead to many others, as I now felt too little of the app&#x27;s code was mine. e.g.:<p><pre><code>  - Added automatic mood analysis. First using sentiment analysis, then changed to a statistical approach
  - Show trends: First implemented TextRank to provide a summary for an individual day, then changed it to extract keywords to spot trends over weeks and months. Replaced TextRank with KeyBERT for speed and n-grams, then BERT-SQuAD, and ended on a modified YAKE [1] for subjectively better results. (Do you know of a better approach?)
</code></pre>
As a result, this tiny app took me over a month, but it still has its flaws:<p><pre><code>  - Transcription is not live but performed on recordings, so if you immediately want the transcript of your most recent answer, you have to wait.
  - Mood and keyphrase extraction are optimized for my languages and way of speaking, so they might not generalize well.
  - Music in the background can result in nearly empty transcripts.
</code></pre>
Nevertheless, after using the app regularly and enjoying it, I feel ready to release.
Hope you will find the app useful too.<p>[0] Show HN: Whisper.cpp <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33877893"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33877893</a><p>[1] YAKE: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LIAAD&#x2F;yake"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LIAAD&#x2F;yake</a>",story,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fouryou-guided-audio-journal/id1671616134,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
