34666366,Show HN: Nuggets – Explore interesting reads with GPT-3.5,2023-02-05T16:47:10Z,nbrickell,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN! Excited to share Nuggets publicly after a few months of development in private beta.<p>The problem<p>1. It&#x27;s hard to find thoughtful writing on the topics you care about. Mainstream media is becoming increasingly polarised and hard to trust. Thoughtful, rational writing is typically hosted on independent websites and publications - e.g. paulgraham.com or Substack, but this can be hard to find. RSS helps but it&#x27;s noisy.<p>2. It&#x27;s hard to deep-dive on a topic. Finding different perspectives requires sifting through a noisy Twitter timeline or actively looking across multiple publications. Conversation is segregated by user or publication, creating filter bubbles.<p>3. Social media is noisy and can be emotionally draining. Interesting discussions are buried beneath the noise, and a single timeline forces you into reading items that keep you scrolling rather than understanding.<p>The solution<p>Nuggets surfaces engaging articles with related conversation from your Twitter network. Each article includes a GPT-3.5-based chatbot (&#x27;Nugg&#x27;) for discussing the article or digging-in to any topic.<p>With Nuggets, you can:<p><pre><code>  - Find engaging reads with a &#x27;For You&#x27; feed
  - Save items to create feeds &amp; discover new reads in the topics you&#x27;re interested in
  - Discuss articles with a GPT-3.5-based chatbot that understands an article&#x27;s context
  - See tweets that link to an article to get an idea for the surrounding conversation
  - Find alternative perspectives with related reads and tweets
  - Semantically search tweets and articles (more on this coming soon)
</code></pre>
The mission is to promote better discussion through better understanding - to provide an environment to explore and really understand the topics you’re interested in and the surrounding conversation.<p>Try it out by opening an article via URL here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.thenuggets.app&#x2F;search?url"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.thenuggets.app&#x2F;search?url</a> and sign up with the code HN for 10 free messages with Nugg + a month&#x27;s subscription. It currently requires a Twitter login; sorry for the required signup - I’m bootstrapping so have to try to control the OpenAI + AWS costs!<p>Hope you enjoy &amp; let me know if you have any questions or comments!",story,https://thenuggets.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
