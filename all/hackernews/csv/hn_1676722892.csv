They have been locked out, presumably due to bad security. The page does not seem to be defaced. The account will be deleted in less than a week. Upon logging in, I am presented with a message that the account has been locked and two buttons. One says &quot;Download my information&quot;, which <i>would</i> be satisfactory, but upon clicking on it, a message saying &quot;Download request unsuccessful&quot; comes up. The second button redirects to the help center, where a form can be submitted, but alas, there has been no response.<p>This is my last shot in the dark, as it probably is for many people who post requests like this. I thank the HN administrators for their consideration of this request and anyone who is able to help me with this.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;profile.php?id=100063644376851",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
