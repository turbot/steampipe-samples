Micro is a platform for API development. It combines a lot of the core primitives you&#x27;d expect from a cloud platform as a single logical server. The closest equivalent is Dapr.io. It bakes in the concept of environments, source to running builds and a framework for Go development.<p>It&#x27;s useful where you want to write backend services in Go and expose them through a single API (also included in Micro).<p>We once wrote about &quot;Netlify for the frontend, Micro for the backend&quot; <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25068782"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25068782</a> which went down well on HN. From a purely open source perspective my goal is to continue to evolve Micro as a community led effort, whereas previously I was trying to push for VC funding and building a product (been there, done that with M3O.com powered by Micro).<p>By sharing this I&#x27;m hoping to just shine a light on the upcoming trend of platform engineering and the need for platform APIs as part of the offering.<p>If this doesn&#x27;t go down well, I&#x27;ll write a more thoughtful blog post on platform APIs and how Micro&#x2F;Dapr play a role in that.",story,https://micro.dev,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
