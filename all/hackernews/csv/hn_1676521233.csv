Do you feel like your decisions would change? Even if it was the exact same situation&#x2F;decision you are faced with today, do you think you would be playing it differently if you had more ownership?

34814839,Ask HN: Is it necessary to set SaaS pricing based on amount of database rows?,2023-02-16T04:02:28Z,greenie_beans,1,false,false,,,,,,"Say you have a e-commerce SaaS with pricing like this:
- $150&#x2F;month up to 10k inventory items
- $200&#x2F;month up to 50k inventory items
- $250&#x2F;month up to 100k inventory items
- $300&#x2F;month up to 200k inventory items<p>Is that necessary from a technological point of view, or is that strictly a business thing that is trying to use the pricing tiers to help with revenue? Seems like a case of artificial scarcity? It seems like limiting the number of items isn&#x27;t necessary and the costs of maintaining a large database(s) are relatively fixed as you scale up, so why not offer everybody the same amount of items?<p>I know that a database can only hold so many items, but are there problems with scale where too many items will slow things down? If you only have 500 tenants, that&#x27;s not a huge issue? The issue is a lot tenants, right? (I guess it matters how you&#x27;re doing multi-tenancy.) Presumably if you&#x27;re big enough you can shard and all those tricks that I&#x27;m vaguely aware of but never had to deal with.<p>What am I missing? Note that I&#x27;ve never worked on a large database so I&#x27;m quite ignorant — please be gentle!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
