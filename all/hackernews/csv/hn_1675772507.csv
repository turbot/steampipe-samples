You need to build trust! This means, no features and no benefits!<p>You do not build trust by giving them:<p>1) You have these issues + my product solves them (Insert Features)<p>Developers, engineers and other team members get these kinds of claims all the time and they simply just don&#x27;t build trust and they are so over-used that they don&#x27;t spark any curiosity among tech folk.<p>2) &quot;Stop losing time&quot;, &quot;Save money&quot;, &quot;Be the most valuable player in your team&quot; ... (Insert Benefits)<p>These might spark some curiosity, but on the other hand, it might even get tech folk mad at you. This is just too vague of a message. Why would they trust you?<p>How then do you build trust?<p>Talk about PROBLEMS!
You have a product that probably solves some problems, right? Well, talk about them.<p>Do not talk about how your super-mega-extra-cool product solves them, just make content talking about the problem. How it&#x27;s usually handled, what are the pains behind it and so on.<p>Do it long-form, or short-form, on LinkedIn, on Twitter, in video format, podcasts and so on.<p>Talk about them on places developers usually hang out. Some of the obvious choices are relevant slack groups, tech Twitter, relevant subreddits, Indie hackers, and so on.<p>Put your company or your name behind it (although, people usually react better to a real person, rather then to a company logo). Be useful! Engage with the community.<p>Then, after you&#x27;ve built enough trust, you will be able to reap what you saw, and that means, getting all those people that trust you to try out your super-mega-extra-cool product and they&#x27;ll give you an honest review.<p>All you need to do at this point is listen!<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand!<p>You should definitely communicate your features on places like your website, LinkedIn company page and similar.<p>In the business-to-developers market, this is essential for early-stage startups. When tech-folk come to your website they&#x27;ll give you a very short speed date to get to know you. Communicating benefits won&#x27;t tell them if they need you, features will.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

have more than 80 characters long sentences.<p>SPECIAL NOTE: The extension takes a general approach and is not site specific, therefore, it will not work on all websites.
