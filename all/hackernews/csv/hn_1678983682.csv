We&#x27;ve been working together on various projects since 2014, and our latest one is something we&#x27;re really excited about.<p>Since October 2022 we&#x27;ve been working on NewArc.ai (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newarc.ai"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newarc.ai</a>), a tool that allows creating beautiful illustrations with ease.<p>When Stable Diffusion was released publicly in September 2020, we played around with it, trying to find the best way to use it in the work of designers and illustrators.<p>We realised that text-to-image generation in Stable Diffusion was great for inspiration, but not suitable for creating final images because of its creativity. That&#x27;s why we combined image-to-image generation, ControlNet and the ability to train custom models (Dream Booth, LORA) to create a tool that allows illustrators to define composition, colour, and style to generate images with predictable results.<p>Today we&#x27;re releasing the first version of our service for illustrators, and here’s how it works:<p>1. Upload a sketch to define the composition and colours. It will allow you to generate predictable draft illustrations.<p>2. Select one of our standard styles or add your very own style. Generate dozens of drafts that match your style, colour, and composition requirements.<p>3. Choose the best draft illustration that matches your vision, then add the finishing touches in your favourite graphics editor to make it perfect.<p>So illustrators can say goodbye to tedious work, save time and get more done or enjoy more freedom.<p>Happy to further discuss details in the comments!",story,https://www.newarc.ai,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

             ↗     ↘
    Higher Rank   More Upvotes
             ↖     ↙
                ←
</code></pre>
As a consequence, success on HN depends almost entirely on getting enough upvotes in the first hour or so to make the front page and get caught in this feedback loop. And getting these early upvotes is largely a matter of timing, luck, and moderator decisions. And so the best stories don&#x27;t always make the front page, and the stories on the front page are not always the best.<p>Our proposed solution is to use upvoteRate instead of upvotes in the ranking formula. upvoteRate is an estimate of how much more or less likely users are to upvote a story compared to the average story, taking account how much attention the story as received, based on a history of the ranks and times at which it has been shown. You can read about how we calculate this metric in more detail here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme</a><p>About 1.5 years ago, we published an article with this basic idea of counteracting the rank-upvotes feedback loop by using attention as negative feedback. We received very valuable input from the HN community (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659</a>). Quality News has been created based largely on this feedback.<p>Currently, Quality News shows the upvoteRate metric for live Hacker News data, as well as charts of the rank and upvote history of each story. We have not yet implemented an alternative ranking algorithm, because we don&#x27;t have access to data on flags and moderator actions, which are a major component of the HN ranking score.<p>We&#x27;d love to see the Hacker News team experiment with the new formula, perhaps on an alternative front page. This will allow the community to evaluate whether the new ranking formula is an improvement over the current one.<p>We look forward discussing our approach with you!<p>Links:<p>Site: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.social-protocols.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.social-protocols.org&#x2F;</a><p>Readme: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme</a><p>Previous Blog Post: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felx.me&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;improving-the-hacker-news-ranking-algorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felx.me&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;improving-the-hacker-news-ranking...</a><p>Previous Discussion: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659</a>",story,https://news.social-protocols.org/top,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
