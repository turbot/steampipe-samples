I need some advice on whether to pursue a Masters after finishing my Bachelor degree.<p>I&#x27;ve tried doing some independent research on this, and the answer I&#x27;ve arrived at is: it depends!<p>I am currently in my second year of University in London, and while studying I&#x27;m also doing a part-time SWE internship at LEGO. This will continue in my third year, and it looks like I will be offered a job once I graduate in 2024.<p>With that in mind, would it make any sense for me to go for a Masters degree and delay working in industry for one year?<p>I&#x27;m mostly thinking in terms of opportunities in the future and personal development.<p>I should also note that my current University is not very prestitious, but my grades are excellent, so I believe I could be accepted into a better one for a MSc.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

However, it couldn&#x27;t find an online source that would provide a satisfactory amount of data to be really useful to compare different models. So I took what data I could find to set up a Bayesian regression model.<p>Find the results and more details on the linked page. Hope this is useful or of interest.

Search is fascinating, there are so many features you can add to a search engine, but I find that the existing search engines are a bit limited in the features they have to offer. So I decided to work on my own search engine to test out different features, searching algorithms, and front ends in order to improve my (and hopefully others) searching experience.<p>Ichido includes a tagging system that provides more info on search results. For example, if a site links to Google services or uses Cloudflare, a tag is shown with the search result that let&#x27;s the user know about that site&#x27;s use of those services. Ichido also includes links to RSS feeds in search results, making it much easier to find RSS feeds.<p>This search engine is free to use, but if you like the service and want to support continued development please consider making a donation (Ichido currently supports donations through Libera Pay).",story,https://ichi.do/?q=news,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
