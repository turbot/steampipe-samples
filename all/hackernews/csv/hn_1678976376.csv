Aperture provides a reliability abstraction layer, enabling globalized load control for easier management across distributed microservice architectures.<p>DoorDash uses Aperture and detailed its implementation in a recent blog post[1], discussing microservice architecture failures such as cascading failure, retry storm, death spiral, and metastable failure. The post also examines the limitations of existing countermeasures like load shedding, circuit breakers, and auto-scaling in coordinating mitigation across services.<p>Our CTO, Tanveer Gill, recently demonstrated Aperture&#x27;s capabilities at a conference[2]. Aperture uses prioritized load shedding for automatic detection and handling of request overloads, enabling graceful degradation and prioritization. Its unified intelligent load management system coordinates services during outages, and distributed rate limiting protects vulnerable APIs from heavy-hitters.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doordash.engineering&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;14&#x2F;failure-mitigation-for-microservices-an-intro-to-aperture&#x2F;
