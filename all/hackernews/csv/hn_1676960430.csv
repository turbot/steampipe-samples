34877254,Show HN: Gargantuan Takeout Rocket – Google Takeout Transloader to Azure,2023-02-21T05:56:57Z,crazysim,2,false,false,,,,,,"Been broken for 4 months, just got back to fixing it and validating. Figured I&#x27;ll repost this.<p>Gargantuan Takeout Rocket (GTR) is a toolkit to make the pain of backing up a Google account to somewhere that&#x27;s not Google a lot less. At the moment the only destination supported is Azure.<p>It&#x27;s a guide, a browser extension, a Cloudflare worker to deploy, and Azure storage to configure. This sounds like buzzword creep, but believe me, every piece is extremely important.<p>It&#x27;s very cheap to run&#x2F;serverless. You can backup a Google account at about $1&#x2F;TB.<p>Compared to renting a VPS to do this, it&#x27;s much more pleasant. You aren&#x27;t juggling strange URLs, needing big beefy boxes to buffer large data, or trying to login to Google or pass URLs through a VPS. Unfortunately, not everything about the procedure can be automated. But whatever can be, is.<p>It&#x27;s <i>very</i> fast. 1GB&#x2F;s is the stable default and recommended speed. However, you can have about 3 of these going at a time for about 3GB&#x2F;s+ overall. This trick is accomplished by making Azure download from Google to a file block, a unique API not seen in S3 or S3-like object storage.<p>Unfortunately, Azure has URL handling bugs and only supports HTTP 1.1, greatly limiting parallelism. We can use Cloudflare Workers to work around these issues.<p>I use GTR myself with a scheduled Google Takeout every two months to backup 1.5TB of data from Google. This can be photos, YouTube videos, etc. I can finish my backups to safe non-Google storage in 15 minutes after I get an email from Google that my Takeout is ready to be downloaded.<p>Unfortunately the only destination is currently Azure. There&#x27;s also no encryption support. And also Cloudflare is involved. That said, if you&#x27;re fine with this, this is a fine way to backup a Google and Youtube account as-is.",story,https://github.com/nelsonjchen/gargantuan-takeout-rocket,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
