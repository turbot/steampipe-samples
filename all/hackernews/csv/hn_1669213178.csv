In contrast to all existing approaches, it unclutters articles by modifying their CSS instead of extracting the text content.<p>This results in a more visually pleasing result that reuses the original article style. The idea is to remove friction so you use the reader mode more often.
There are a few more features around saving articles automatically and taking highlights -- more details are on the website.<p>The extension has about 400 active weekly users right now, mostly from organic web store traffic. Monetisation has proven to be hard and for freemium there would need to be much higher numbers anyways.
