It was great for travelling internationally: run the script and after a few minutes one had a cloud instance and everything one needed to securely access the Internet through one’s own country.<p>Unfortunately, it was archived in 2021.  Is there anything in 2023 which approaches it?  I’ve seen Algo[1], but I don’t believe it does as much to help one to avoid censorship.  It’s also based on Ubuntu rather than Debian, which seems like a mistake with security-conscious server software.<p>0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StreisandEffect&#x2F;streisand<p>1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trailofbits&#x2F;algo",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
