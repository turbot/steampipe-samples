Relevant content is fed to the bot from a FAISS index (Langchain makes this super easy). I used the CFPB as it struck me as the most neutral and factual of various online content sources.<p>- I also provide the bot with up-to-date mortgage rate data from the Federal Reserve&#x27;s FRED service.<p>The bot could definitely be improved:<p>- I tried letting GPT3 ask the user questions about their mortgage situation in order to be more helpful but found it overly aggressive and off-putting. I think this is definitely feasible, but requires more thought.<p>- Websockets can be a pain, and I&#x27;d probably want to use server-side events in production to stream results to the bot client.<p>h&#x2F;t to:<p>- Langchain and community.<p>- The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.",story,https://demo.mortgagelab.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
