Main goals would be to give much more visibility than today to all my activities, not just the newsletter, and of course make some extra money if possible.<p>After some research, Substack and Beehiiv seem the best candidates, but I am not sure yet, and there may be others.<p>Ideally, I would need a platform that:<p>0. supports paid subscriptions<p>1. supports comments<p>2. has no *fixed* costs<p>3. allows *migrating* every post to a personal blog, after a month or so, leaving in the platform just a message like &quot;this post is now available &lt;here&gt;<p>4. lets me say below each post or email &quot;I also do other stuff, and you can support that other with donations&quot;<p>IIUC, ONLY Substack checks the first 3 marks, but (even AFTER reading their Publisher Agreement) I am not sure if it allows n. 4 or not.<p>Every feedback is welcome, including pointers to other platforms that I may have missed!<p>Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
