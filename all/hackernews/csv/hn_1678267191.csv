35066574,Isoflow is going open source,2023-03-08T08:20:43Z,markmanx,1,false,false,,,,,,"Isoflow was a free diagramming tool I launched back in 2020 for sketching network diagrams quickly. It grew quickly after reaching #1 on ProductHunt, and since then I&#x27;ve built it into a small SaaS with a modest customer base.<p>Over the last year, I’ve hit a ceiling. As a developer I&#x27;ve found it hard to grow Isoflow past the 50 customers it currently has.  As an alternative route, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot more about open sourcing the diagram editor, but couldn&#x27;t really get a full picture of the benefits until recently. So how do I justify open-sourcing the core of my SaaS business (which I&#x27;ve been working on for over 2 years as a solo developer), and is this the best thing to do for Isoflow&#x27;s future (spoiler alert: yes!).<p>For one, contributing to OSS is A Good Thing(TM), and I believe it will ultimately make Isoflow into a better diagramming tool (which is important to me as I believe the future is full of diagramming tools that help us learn faster and grasp ideas more easily). But what really convinced me are the examples I&#x27;ve seen of other diagramming SaaS&#x27;s that benefit from open sourcing their cores (Excalidraw and React-flow to name a couple). I&#x27;d like to live off my project someday, and previously where I saw more drawbacks than gains going open source, I now strongly believe that if Isoflow becomes a success on the OSS side, that success will feed back into the business side (for example, through people finding the repo and then driving through to the SaaS, sponsorship, or custom support requests coming in from companies), and so everyone wins.<p>I&#x27;ll be working to release Isoflow under the MIT license, you can find the start of the open-source project here at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markmanx&#x2F;isoflow (feel free to star!).",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The fear and neuroticism that permeate through the outer threads of this group is palpable, and if left unchecked, could result in years of suffering and blog posting<p>To that end, I&#x27;ve decided to do my part. I&#x27;ve decided to go all out to create AGI, in order to end the suffering of rationalist AGI doomers once and for all and to improve the vibes on lesswrong and HN.<p>To start this ambitious project, I&#x27;ve sold all my possessions and have been living in a van down by the river, solely dedicating myself to this cause. I&#x27;ve even convinced my mother to give me her life savings for the project.<p>So far I’ve watched ex machina 19 times and I’ve started taking the same wakefulness supplements people use at the skatepark. I’ve been using anki to learn assembly and notably I’m looking for a cofounder. Please join me in the battle to save my fellow humans from stress.   WE Will: create the first motivational agent model with access to an enterprise grade kubetnates cluster and elons tweets<p>We will resort to using unconventional methods, such as timed feedings of Soylent. Cold showers and loud music. Cold calling y-combinator. Socializing in cobol syntax. Gloating about clean code and new JavaScript frameworks.
