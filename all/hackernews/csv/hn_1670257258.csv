33867565,BIS warns of $80T in hidden off-balance sheet debt held by pension funds,2022-12-05T16:20:20Z,JSDevOps,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has issued a warning that pension funds and other non-bank financial firms now hold more than $80 trillion of hidden, off-balance sheet dollar debt in the form of foreign exchange (FX) swaps. This is a staggering amount of money, and it has raised concerns about the potential risks to the global financial system.<p>According to the BIS, these FX swaps are being used as a way to avoid regulatory scrutiny and to mask the true level of leverage in the financial system. The BIS has called on regulators to take action to address this issue and to ensure that non-bank financial firms are held to the same standards as banks when it comes to disclosing their true level of leverage.<p>The $80 trillion of off-balance sheet dollar debt held by pension funds and other non-bank financial firms represents a significant portion of the global economy. This has raised concerns that a potential financial crisis could have far-reaching consequences, not just for the financial sector but for the global economy as a whole.<p>The BIS has urged regulators to take action to address this issue, and has called on pension funds and other non-bank financial firms to be more transparent about their use of FX swaps and other forms of off-balance sheet debt. The BIS has also warned that failure to address this issue could result in serious consequences for the global financial system.<p>The UK government has yet to comment on this warning from the BIS, but it is expected that they will take the issue seriously and will work with regulators and the financial industry to address this potential risk to the global economy.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It&#x27;s just ELIZA in a more modern form.<p>###<p>Explain why NFTs might be of interest to video game players as a digital asset.<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that are unique and cannot be replicated or exchanged for something else of equal value. In the context of video games, NFTs can be used to represent unique in-game items, such as a rare weapon or piece of virtual real estate. These items can be traded or sold to other players, providing a way for players to own and trade digital assets in a secure and verifiable way. Because NFTs are unique and cannot be replicated, they can also provide a way for game developers to create scarcity and value for certain in-game items, which can drive demand and engagement from players.<p>Are these tokens usable outside the game for which they were purchased?<p>It depends on the specific game and the nature of the NFT. In some cases, NFTs may only be usable within the game for which they were purchased, and may not have any value or use outside of that game. In other cases, NFTs may be designed to be used across multiple games or platforms, providing more flexibility and utility for the owner. It&#x27;s important to read the terms and conditions for the specific NFT you&#x27;re interested in, as well as any information provided by the game developer, to understand its intended use and potential limitations.<p>Is the speculative aspect the main driver of interest in video game NFTs, or is it an aspect of the game&#x27;s playability, or something else?<p>!

This is a request to any HN Googlers or HN users that know any Googlers that can help.<p>A couple of weeks ago I saw a fraudulent charge on my credit card, so I reported it. My card got cancelled and we got issued two new ones that would arrive in 10-14 business days. My partner switched to paying her Google account to her own card, and when the new cards arrived, she switched over to the new one. This event triggered the Google algorithm to send her this email:<p>```

We&#x27;re having trouble processing your payment for Google One. In order to keep your membership, please verify or update your payment information on Google Play.
If you don&#x27;t take action, your Google One membership will end. You are currently using 80.32 GB of storage and when your membership expires you&#x27;ll be above your storage limit and won&#x27;t be able to send or receive emails on your Gmail account or upload new files to Google Drive and Google Photos. You can avoid interruptions by updating your payment information.
```<p>It&#x27;s been a week since she filled out the form and has yet to hear back anything. One of those emails references a January 8th deadline, but then inside of her account it says has only a few days left before her entire account gets shutdown. We&#x27;ve tried all types of payments, including a Google Play gift card, as well as sending her money from a debit account and PayPayl via Google Pay. All attempts have been rejected.<p>The username of the account in question is `into.the.sea.1839`. I&#x27;m posting it this way to avoid her email address from being web scraped. I think she&#x27;s had this address for over 15 years. I&#x27;ve had mine for over 20.<p>Any help would be appreciated.

They feel betrayed when I tell them that the artwork I showed them was generated by a program. It suddenly feels less meaningful to them, much like the contrast between artisanal and industrial goods.<p>This made me realize that the Federal Trade Commission (or equivalent organization) might soon step in and draft a &quot;<i>Made by Human</i>&quot; labeling rule to distinguish all works of literature and art made by a &quot;human mind&quot; as opposed to something mostly generated by an AI algorithm.<p>We might be a decade away from fully generated movies but you can already make beautiful paintings, short stories and rpg settings out of tools like AI dungeon. I&#x27;m pretty sure ChatGPT can write convincing (at least for outsiders) non-fiction books. If it&#x27;s not already happened, generated literature will soon FLOOD marketplaces. Amazon is already struggling with tons of low-quality books whose only purpose is to to fill this-or-that marketing niche.<p>However, drawing the line might be more difficult than it seems. What if you&#x27;re a graphic designer and you write a combinatorial program to generate abstract posters you plan to sell? In my mind, that would still count as &quot;<i>Made by Human</i>&quot;.
