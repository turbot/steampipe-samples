35029174,Show HN: We’ve Built an All-in-One Subscription Management Toolkit,2023-03-05T12:51:28Z,rajool,1,false,false,,,,,,"Good day HN!
This is Ali, the co-founder and CEO of Hengam (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hengam.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hengam.io</a>). With 3 different apps up and running, Hengam is a Shopify app studio.<p>About one year ago, we launched Subify, a Shopify subscription management app (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.shopify.com&#x2F;subify-subscriptions"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.shopify.com&#x2F;subify-subscriptions</a>). It was a delicate decision from the start, but we took the risk and got into the competition with big companies that already had a reputation in the field.<p>My team started with reviewing the competitors and analyzing the users’ needs and pain points. Since last year, we&#x27;ve come up with new releases every fortnight with features that are custom-tailored to the business&#x27; needs and user requests (gathered through Canny). 
My goal was to make Subify an app that is easy to use, personalized and caring, and inclusively functional.
Shopify store owners turn to subscriptions in search for recurring revenue, predictive MRR, and an increased LTV. Each of them has their own exact interpretation of how a subscription system should work, including specific billing plans. My intention was to make Subify the go-to solution for all these scenarios, and ever since, my team and I have been working towards that end.<p>In the past few months, my team has worked really hard on making our dunning&#x2F;billing management as easy as it can get.<p>(1) We started with adding the prepay option to the app’s settings. Subscription customers are not normally looking for a prepay button, but this can change a lot if you offer a discount, only for the prepay plan. So I had my team work on the combination of the tools that could make this scenario work, plus the UX design that could make it easy to understand.<p>(2) Next, was the discount itself. My experience with studying the subscription brands has taught me that succeeding in the subscription industry is mainly bound to keeping the customers interested in making repeated purchases with your brands. Discounts make that possible. So in addition to a discount percentage that could be applied to a set of products, assigned to a certain rule, my team has added the manual discount feature which will allow customers to insert the exact amount of money they’d like to decrease from the original price.<p>(3) Our next project was to create a dashboard that would be able to cover multiple aspects of a brand&#x27;s relationship with its customers. Cancellation is an always present risk of launching a subscription business, and it was my job to give my merchants some control over that. So through the app panel, we added the option to choose about the cancellation limits. Now, whether subscribers could cancel their subscription after one successful payment, after 100, or at any time, remains up to the store owner.<p>(4) The other feature’s idea came from our own users. For many reasons (inventory, restock, or even marketing), brands may be open to receiving subscription orders– up to a limit. After a few weeks, the developers at Subify were able to add the expiration date feature to the panel to be changed according to the user’s preferences. I wanted to cut out all the trouble and make the customers design come true, so as simple as it sounds, this turned out to be exactly how it works: Merchants create a subscription rule, add the subscription products, set an expiration date (e.g. after 10 successful payments), and then, it’s all automatically handled.<p>What I love about the subscription industry? It never fails to surprise. As the days go by, Shopify brands are discovering more ways to benefit from subscriptions. I’d like myself to join this flow as well. 
As you can see, working on new features and tools will be our never-ending job. This was just a small sample and I hope you’ve enjoyed reading about it. We&#x27;re eager to receive comments and advice about our process or anything you&#x27;d suggest for the future; don&#x27;t be afraid to voice your opinion!",story,https://apps.shopify.com/subify-subscriptions,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

example, a startup, or a unit in a established company (say, with max. 50 people). I would like to learn methods 
and best practices on the management of people in such setting.<p>I have background in research in tech, but no formal training in the management science or entrepreneurship (but I 
have some project management experience). I find myself progressively transitioning to managing R&amp;D engineers.<p>I&#x27;m not in a situation to take a formal master&#x27;s program or similar. I am thus looking for a resource that contains 
most of what is required in practice.<p>I wonder if people here have suggestions for, say, a good (text)book or online course?<p>I don&#x27;t need books on self-help, motivation, or otherwise generics, rather, a proper, preferably academic, standard resource. 
I appreciate general advise and suggestions on management as well.<p>Thank you!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I plan to select some of those ideas and implement a “v0” or prototype version of the idea using PyCob, a Python project that makes it easy to create web apps using just Python. The easiest types of apps to implement would be Python libraries that you wish there were a front-end for. I’ll post the demo and code here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pycob.com&#x2F;<p>If you have an idea for a simple web app that you think would be useful or fun, please share it in the comments below. These are some examples of demo apps we’ve made:<p>PyPi Analytics: Show trends of how many downloads PyPi packages have over time<p>HN Analytics: Find the best time to post on Hacker News<p>Dataframe Explorer: Choose fields from a dataframe to pivot and graph the results<p>App Wizard: Generate Python code for a CRUD app<p>Book Summary: Choose a book and get a 10 bullet point summary
AI Regex Generator: Give the app 3 examples and have AI (try to) generate a regex pattern<p>Warranty Claims: Allow users to submit warranty claims and track status of replacement parts<p>These are just a few examples – feel free to suggest any kind of app you can think of!<p>Thanks in advance for your ideas. I&#x27;m excited to see the ideas, and I look forward to implementing some of these apps using PyCob.<p>Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
