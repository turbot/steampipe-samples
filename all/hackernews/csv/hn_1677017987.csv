As I got more familiar with crypto, I wanted to trade more altcoins. But, most aren’t tradeable on centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.
Tried switching to decentralized exchanges and perp platforms like Synthetix and GMX, which just support blue chip tokens. Nothing lets me take leveraged positions in the altcoins I want.<p>Why do I have to wait for GMX or Binance to support BLUR perps? There’s got to be a better way, right?<p>Turns out, there’s not. So we built www.tumbyl.com - it’s a platform that lets you long and short any ERC20. Meaning, it’s the first one-stop-shop for crypto derivatives.
You choose any token to trade, specify size, and confirm in wallet.<p>If you have any specific recommendations or tokens you’d like supported, just comment below. Would love to hear what you guys think!
Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
