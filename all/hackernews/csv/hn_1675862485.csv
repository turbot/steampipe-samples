A few of us got together to build a tool to help teams understand, and improve, how they communicate and collaborate to get stuff done. It’s called TeamDynamics!<p>We’ve always found individual personality tests (MBTI, Enneagram, Big Five, etc.) useful for understanding our 1:1 interactions with others (even if not 100% scientific). But they don&#x27;t capture the 1:N &#x2F; N:1 &#x2F; N:N dynamics that emerge when you mix a bunch of personalities together on a team.<p>Our hope is that TeamDynamics can fill that gap. It:
[1] Gives the user a framework for understanding the “personality” of your team across the types of interactions that matter most in today’s work environment.
[2] Offers suggestions for how you can get more done and have more fun while doing it — both as a group and as an individual — based on your team&#x27;s personality.<p>The “single-player” experience is free to try all month at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.teamdynamics.io&#x2F;start-solo?utm_source=hn&amp;promocode=free_solo_february"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.teamdynamics.io&#x2F;start-solo?utm_source=hn&amp;promoco...</a> and we&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts!
* Do the results of the test resonate with you? 
* Would you invite your team to take this (why or why not)?
* Would this be helpful in defining team norms? Onboarding new hires? Coaching team members? Other use cases?<p>Thanks for giving it a look!<p>---<p>P.S. We put a lot of this together with no-&#x2F;low-code solutions, partly to check out how much that field has developed in just a few years. No surprise to the HN community I&#x27;m sure, but lots of really cool tools out there, and a few that we’re using here are (btw, if you have questions about any of these, or others you&#x27;d suggest, would love to hear them!):
* [Forms + Payments] Tally — which we found right here on HN! <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30258149"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30258149</a> : Awesome, flexible form editor. Way better value than Typeform, Paperform, etc.
* [Website] Webflow: Makes sense that they lead their category, and great community around it. Animations and forms are clunky, and needs more progress on logic.
* [Integrations] Make (f&#x2F;k&#x2F;a Integromat): Way cheaper, and overall better, than Zapier. Could use a more robust community.",story,https://www.teamdynamics.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
