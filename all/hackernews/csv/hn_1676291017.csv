34772530,Why banks partner with fintech for their cross-border payments business,2023-02-13T12:04:35Z,fablefintech,1,false,false,,,,,,"Banks and businesses partner with fintech firms for their cross-border payments business setup because fintech firms offer several benefits that traditional banks and businesses may not be able to provide. Some of these benefits include:<p>Speed and Efficiency: Fintech companies use innovative technology, such as blockchain, which allows for real-time cross-border payments. This is in contrast to traditional banking methods, which can take several days for cross-border payments to be processed.<p>Cost Savings: Fintech firms often use digital currencies, which can reduce the cost associated with cross-border payments compared to traditional methods. For example, TransferWise, a fintech company that specializes in cross-border payments, uses a peer-to-peer model, allowing them to bypass the traditional banking system and reduce the cost associated with cross-border payments. Axis bank has tied up with Fable Fintech, which specialises in providing cost-effective white-label cross-border payment solutions for banks
.
Improved User Experience: Fintech firms often have a more user-friendly and streamlined interface, making it easier for businesses and consumers to make cross-border payments. For example, PayPal, a fintech company that offers cross-border payments, provides an intuitive platform that allows users to make cross-border payments with just a few clicks.<p>Increased Access to Emerging Markets: Fintech firms have a strong presence in emerging markets, providing banks and businesses with access to these markets that they may not have been able to reach otherwise. For example, Remitly, a fintech company that specializes in cross-border payments, has a strong presence in India and the Philippines, providing banks and businesses with access to these markets.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
