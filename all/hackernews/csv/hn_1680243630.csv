35383076,Ask HN: Language that treats key-value DBs like memory?,2023-03-31T05:43:29Z,felipelalli,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello everyone! I&#x27;d like to know if there exists a programming language that, instead of being mapped to memory, is mapped to a key-value database? In other words, one that treats the key-value database as if it were a large memory space? This way, I could, for instance, use any complex data structures like binary trees, linked lists, queues, graphs, etc., as if I were working in memory, but it would actually be done in a key-value database?<p>If such a thing exists or is possible, how would the performance be? I imagine the performance would be significantly degraded? Or could caching help mitigate this? If such a thing exists or could exist, how would the distinction be made between in-memory and persistent structures? For example:<p>A let a_xpto: i32 = 10; would place the value &quot;10&quot; in the memory region called &quot;a_xpto&quot;. If it were persisted, it could be something like: ^let a_xpto: i32 = 10; which would place the binary value &quot;10&quot; in a key-value position with the key &quot;a_xpto&quot; where the &quot;^&quot; directive would indicate that the writing would be done in the database and not in memory.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t such a language solve all the age-old problems we face at the interface between code and databases? I see that today we have numerous databases, each with a different purpose, a different interface, and communication between code&#x2F;data structures in memory vs databases is always very painful. We&#x27;re always left wondering: should we create this function in the database or in the code? How would the performance be? And if I have more than one type of database? How do I integrate them? Should I load everything into memory to filter? Or should I filter something in the database before processing further?<p>Additionally, we end up with that odd-looking code that passes strings to databases. Even when using an interface that &quot;maps&quot; the database to objects, it&#x27;s still not great. It&#x27;s always a pain to modify the database, for instance. If something like what I&#x27;m describing existed, it wouldn&#x27;t matter which database was behind it. I know that Datomic does something in this direction: it abstracts a database, allowing you to easily swap out the underlying database type. However, it&#x27;s still not quite what I&#x27;m talking about. What I&#x27;m describing goes beyond that: you would use the same data structures, objects, etc., that you&#x27;re used to working with in your code, but in a persistent manner.<p>Can anyone shed some light on this?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
35383310,Can companies like SaaS companies like snowflake competele with cloud vendor?,2023-03-31T06:14:53Z,lex2ross,1,false,false,,,,,,"SaaS companies like Snowflake, Databricks, Confluent, and Elastic offer high-quality solutions that work well. However, these services are hosted on different cloud vendors, which can be problematic. Cloud vendors have their own alternative solutions, such as Redshift, BigQuery, PubSub, Kinesis, and OpenSearch, which can make it difficult for SaaS companies to compete.<p>Typically, SaaS companies keep an 80% margin, while cloud vendors keep another 60-70% margin (approximately 65%). So, if you spend $100, $80 goes to the SaaS company, and $13 goes to the cloud vendor, which means only $7 is spent on actual hardware.<p>My hypothesis is that if a cloud vendor were to develop a similar service, such as AWS OpenSearch (an Elastic fork), and offer it at an 80% margin, the cloud vendor solution would cost only $7&#x2F;.2 = $35, which is one-third the cost of the SaaS service. Additionally, the cloud vendor solution would be better integrated with other vendor services, reducing infrastructure management toil.<p>This creates a challenging situation for SaaS companies. To compete with cloud vendors, SaaS solutions would need to be at least 2x better, which is a daunting task given that both SaaS and cloud vendors often use different flavors of open source.<p>My questions for the community members are:<p>1. Do you agree with my hypothesis?
2. If my hypothesis is correct, do you think SaaS companies will be able to survive the tough competition from cloud vendors?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
