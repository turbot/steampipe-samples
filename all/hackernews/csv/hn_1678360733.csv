example, a startup, or a unit in a established company (say, with max. 50 people). I would like to learn methods 
and best practices on the management of people in such setting.<p>I have background in research in tech, but no formal training in the management science or entrepreneurship (but I 
have some project management experience). I find myself progressively transitioning to managing R&amp;D engineers.<p>I&#x27;m not in a situation to take a formal master&#x27;s program or similar. I am thus looking for a resource that contains 
most of what is required in practice.<p>I wonder if people here have suggestions for, say, a good (text)book or online course?<p>I don&#x27;t need books on self-help, motivation, or otherwise generics, rather, a proper, preferably academic, standard resource. 
I appreciate general advise and suggestions on management as well.<p>Thank you!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35080142,Show HN: Ask questions that the social media Zeitgeist will answer,2023-03-09T11:06:10Z,netsroht,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m building a tool that let&#x27;s you ask questions that the social media Zeitgeist--with focus on investing--will answer.<p>Examples:<p>Question: <i>Is the S&amp;P 500 going to rise or fall in 2023?</i>
Answer:<p>&gt; The comments have mixed opinions about whether the S&amp;P 500 will rise or fall in 2023. Some predict a drop in the first quarter of 2023, while others believe it will rebound and end the year higher than it is now. The average forecast expects the S&amp;P 500 to end 2023 at 4,009, but the predictions range from a low of 3,400 to as high as 4,500. Overall sentiment remains bullish on the stock market despite some downside risks.<p>Question: <i>Is it a good idea to DCA in the S&amp;P 500?</i>
Answer:<p>&gt; The comments are mixed, but the majority of them suggest that DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) into the S&amp;P 500 is a good strategy for long-term investment. Some comments suggest waiting for the market to drop further before starting to DCA, while others suggest starting immediately. Some comments also mention the importance of considering the volatility of individual stocks and the benefits of investing in low-cost index funds. Overall, the comments suggest that DCA into the S&amp;P 500 is a safe and effective investment strategy for most people.<p>Question: <i>Who profits from the war in Ukraine?</i>
Answer:<p>&gt; The comments suggest that the US is profiting from the war in Ukraine through its military-industrial complex and arms sales. Some comments also mention that the war is hurting the world economy and that Russia is allegedly providing material support to prolong the conflict. There are also comments that suggest both Ukraine and Russia are profiting from the war.<p>Highlights:<p>- Real-time social media comments<p>- Shows hyperlinked sources<p>- Let&#x27;s you apply a date range filter<p>- Supports asking questions in 20 languages<p>10,000 foot technical view:<p>Social media API &#x2F; crawlers -&gt; DB -&gt; SentenceTransformers -&gt; pgvector -&gt; ranking by Cross-Encoder for MS Marco -&gt; build prompt -&gt; gpt-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT)<p>Data is currently limited to:<p>- Hacker News: All comments starting from August 2021<p>- Reddit: The following subreddits: <i>wallstreetbets, superstonk, stocks, investing, options, thetagang</i> starting from October 2022<p>- Twitter: Currently only user replies (with users having at least 50 followers) to @elonmusk starting from February 2022<p>I hope you enjoy playing around with it, feedback is really appreciated.",story,https://foretale.io/toolbox/Social_Media_QA,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
