34984007,Show HN: A cost calculator for OpenAI GPT Models,2023-03-01T16:16:27Z,vitruvian_man,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hey all,<p>I was on the OpenAI website exploring their model documentation and came across their API pricing page.<p>I had the idea of using programmatic SEO combined with a GPT language model to generate content for fun and see what can rank in Google as a total experiment. (Yes I know Google&#x27;s stance on this.)<p>I wanted to create around 200-500 words of content per page, but needed to know how many tokens that represented and costs in $USD.<p>So I created a simple (perhaps silly) calculator to convert word count into token counts so I can estimate my costs for this project and not get hit with a higher than expected bill.<p>Thus, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gptcostcalculator.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gptcostcalculator.com&#x2F;</a><p>P.S.

I downloaded it but I&#x27;m so reluctant to have anything microsoft in my life (except VSCode), that somehow I&#x27;m willing to tolerate Google over them.<p>Last time I had to setup a Windows PC, and could not do it without setting up a microsoft account (no more offline account setups). This made me double down on my microsoft rejection som much that I&#x27;m afraid to start depending on anything they make because I know how they&#x27;d make me a hostage. Comparatively, I&#x27;m not a Google hostage. I know that because I migrated my company off of G-suite when they started charging.<p>I&#x27;m a bit of a Chrome hostage, but only due to laziness (Issues setting up Brave sync, and some missing FF extensions), but with MSFT, all bets would be off.<p>Does anyone feel that way, and does Bing Chat represent any real advantage for MSFT over Google?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
