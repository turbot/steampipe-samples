Rory from DevDB here.<p>I wanted to share a project that I have been working on that helps development teams use and share realistic data from their apps, for use in development environments.<p>Basically, DevDB is a Database as a Service platform, but with a specific focus on development workflows. It allows you to create “images” of development data (for example from your production or staging environments) and then very quickly create more databases with this image for development purposes. Some use cases are:<p>- Use realistic data in CI pipelines for testing database migrations;<p>- Quickly test your application with different datasets (especially useful when you run multiple instances of an application for different customers)<p>- Develop locally with very large datasets that may be impractical to use in a local database<p>- Share the most up to date testing data easily with your team, and quickly update existing testing databases with it.<p>I also created an “Anonymization Engine” which allows you to anonymize production data, by specifying tables and columns to anonymize, and then specifying an action, including using data from the faker library, fixed data, or an SQL command. This currently only works with MySQL, but I am working to bring this to Postgres too.<p>The project is still in early stages, but it would be great to get your feedback! Any questions are more than welcome :)",story,https://devdb.cloud/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Not diminishing in any way the efforts from the creators, mind you.<p>If anything, these AI hype could be a signal of human dawn fall: once students start using these tools to write their essays, writers start publishing AI-generated books and getting paid for that, or scientists start publishing papers produced mostly by AIs, such tools will be the new normal and we may get dumber and dumber as a species because AI will do mostly everything for us.
