Most of the codebases I&#x27;ve worked with over the years have been very ad-hoc or not very close to the bleeding edge. Or, the highly performant codebases really weren&#x27;t amenable to hacking -- just for performing the main function they were built for (a single paper, benchmark, service, etc).<p>I&#x27;ve spent 120-130 hours or so rebuilding David Page&#x27;s lovely record-setting dawnbench project (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myrtle.ai&#x2F;learn&#x2F;how-to-train-your-resnet&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myrtle.ai&#x2F;learn&#x2F;how-to-train-your-resnet&#x2F;</a>) in a way that is generic and amenable to both hacking and rapid experimentation&#x2F;prototyping. One benefit of this is that the original code is extremely performance optimized, so not only is it an easy workbench to prototype on, but a good testbed for if a new method is orthogonal or not to older methods.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to make it as absolutely plug and play as possible -- to get started (if you&#x27;ve done your code scan due diligence and you&#x27;re setup on CUDA), you can just run `git clone <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tysam-code&#x2F;hlb-CIFAR10"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tysam-code&#x2F;hlb-CIFAR10</a> &amp;&amp; cd hlb-CIFAR10 &amp;&amp; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt &amp;&amp; python main.py` and you should see things training straightaway.<p>I hope this offers a nice combination of being fun and useful. I&#x27;ve already gotten a significant amount of value in testing some methods that would otherwise be very hard to test with it. In both cases, either change required just a single line to be added, which I felt validated the original design decisions. I have some hopefully-not-to-nefarious plans for it if I can get it down to the ~2 seconds mark within a few years.<p>I have a Patreon for those interested in seeing more similar work from me in the future. You can get that and other info from the github link above.<p>I plan on hanging around in the comments for a while in case anyone has any questions. Please do let me know, I love the conversation, and whether or not you like&#x2F;liked it, or if you find this intriguing or not -- this helps me build better software in the future!

Sure there are 3rd party providers, but they only seem to focus on the basics, like running a job when a commit is pushed. But, if you choose something like GitHub Actions, you are now locked into their platform, making switching Git hosting providers very painful.<p>* YAML. Everything is YAML. Sometimes it is just one big file (Gitlab, Travis, CircleCI, etc), and it becomes very hard to maintain very quickly. Workflows for GitHub Actions can be split up into different files, but at the end of the day, you are still writing YAML, which means no loops, conditionals, functions, and so forth. In addition, you must follow a strict file structure, meaning very little room for customization. In many cases, you need to write a Makefile&#x2F;Python&#x2F;shell script for more complex situations.<p>Does anyone else share these annoyances?
