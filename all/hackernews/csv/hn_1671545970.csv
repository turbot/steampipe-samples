We currently store all of our data in a monolithic database. Our biggest challenge at the moment is data change management, and I&#x27;m a little over my head. I&#x27;d be most grateful if anyone has reading&#x2F;resources&#x2F;solutions to recommend, especially if they&#x27;re not massively overengineered (we don&#x27;t need FAANG scale scaling).<p>By data change management, I mean things like the following:<p>- When our schemas change, knowing which data falls under the previous vs new schema (e.g. if we add a column, being able to distinguish between NULLs that came after the new schema launches vs before).<p>- When our schemas need to change, identifying all the code that depended on the previous schema<p>- Being able to incrementally update schemas without having to rewrite all code with dependencies on the old schema in a big-bang (i.e. the two can coexist for a time)<p>- Ideally, avoiding duplicating our data for every change<p>- Sometimes the data we ingest has errors. We&#x27;d like a standardised way of tagging where we&#x27;re aware of these errors (e.g. to exclude certain time ranges from ML models), without just overwriting&#x2F;cleaning the data<p>- An external data provider is going through a big migration and rebuilding their systems. There will be a dual-run period where we&#x27;ll get the same data set from different systems at different times, and we need a constant view of what is the latest view. We have a huge amount of code that reads from the first data set directly, so if we&#x27;re going to do a big refactor, I want to build in a way that will be less-huge of a rewrite in future. I could just create a merged table &#x2F; view and use that as the source of truth in future, but I suspect there&#x27;s a more elegant way I&#x27;m missing<p>Our main selection criteria are:<p>- Fast (for a small number of end-users)<p>- Fit-for-purpose: Whiz-bang solutions for non-tabular data like images aren&#x27;t strictly necessary yet, although no harm if they have that flexibility<p>- Affordable: We currently spend around $250pm. While that can grow, we can&#x27;t really justify huge, enterprise-scale investments<p>- Plausibly maintainable by a small team<p>I appreciate that these criteria can conflict with one another, so I guess the biggest trade-off we can make is that we don&#x27;t need super high scalability.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
