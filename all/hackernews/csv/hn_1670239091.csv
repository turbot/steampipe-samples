33863749,Discuss HN: Software Careers Post ChatGPT+,2022-12-05T10:32:39Z,rich_sasha,1,false,false,1,[33863819],<null>,<null>,<null>,"We&#x27;ve all seen it - ChatGPT genuinely solving coding puzzles. Clearly, <i>clearly</i>, that&#x27;s a long way from building MVP products, designing new programming languages or writing &quot;Hello World&quot; in Haskell. But it&#x27;s also a long way since even GPT-3, never mind status quo 10 years ago. It would be cool to discuss what a future looks like where &quot;human operators&quot; of programming are competing against a machine. I don&#x27;t think it is imminent, but equally I think it&#x27;s less imminent than I did a week ago.<p>Some threads that come to mind:<p>- Are these language models better than current offshore outsourced coders? These can code too, sort of, and yet they don&#x27;t threaten the software industry (much).<p>- What would SEs do if any layperson can say &quot;hey AI slave, write me a program that...&quot;? What would we, literally, do? Are there other, undersaturated professions we&#x27;d go into, where analytical thinking is required? Could we, ironically, wake up in a future where thinking skills are taken over by machine, and it&#x27;s other skills - visual, physical labour, fine motor skills - that remain unautomated?<p>- Are we even the first ones in the firing line? Clearly, for now AI progress is mostly in text-based professions; we haven&#x27;t seen a GPT equivalent for video comprehension, for example. Are lawyers at risk? Writers?<p>- What can SEs do, realistically, to protect themselves? Putting the genie back in the bottle is not, as discussed many times in other threads, an option.<p>- Or is it all bogus (with justification), and we&#x27;re fine?<p>No doubt ChatGPT will chip in...",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
33863718,The dangerous trend of inexperienced individuals flooding the tech market,2022-12-05T10:29:01Z,JSDevOps,2,false,false,2,"[33863740,33863923]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"As the demand for technology continues to grow, so does the influx of people entering the tech field. However, this surge in interest has also led to a saturation of the market with individuals who may not have the necessary skills and experience to excel in the field.<p>In recent years, we&#x27;ve seen a rise in the number of people who have no prior experience in technology but claim to be experts in the field after completing a short course in a specific technology. These so-called &quot;experts&quot; are often referred to as &quot;cloud-washed&quot; or &quot;bootcamp graduates&quot; and lack the depth of knowledge and understanding that comes with years of experience.<p>Additionally, we&#x27;re seeing a trend of people calling themselves &quot;data scientists&quot; after completing a three-week course in Python. These individuals may have a basic understanding of the language, but they do not have the necessary skills and experience to truly be considered data scientists.<p>The tech field is not for everyone, and it&#x27;s important for individuals to carefully consider their skills and experience before entering the market. It&#x27;s also crucial for companies to properly vet candidates and ensure that they have the necessary experience and expertise to succeed in their roles.<p>In short, the tech field may be saturated with inexperienced individuals, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a worthwhile pursuit for those with the skills and experience to excel.
