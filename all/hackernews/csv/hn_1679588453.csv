Our team has been working hard on this project for 6 months, and we&#x27;re excited to finally share it with the HN community.<p>With Tripnotes, you can keep track of all your notes about travel when planning to visit a city. Paste in article URLs, videos, emails, text messages, any other text, and if you need some help with research, ask our Concierge which will provide useful recommendations and itineraries for the city in question - with a fallback to GPT for things we didn&#x27;t quite understand.<p>If you&#x27;re not ready to dive right in, here are a few short highlight videos:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1619047755271536640"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1619047755271536640</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1621172173598756864"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1621172173598756864</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1623703548545445890"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1623703548545445890</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1638010661694234625"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1638010661694234625</a><p>All the places by Tripnotes are from our own database, but we rely upon GPT to understand the intent of the incoming prompts, as well as to help with the prose in our response to ensure the place descriptions fit what&#x27;s being asked for.<p>Since we tweeted about our preview release on Monday, we&#x27;ve had over 15,000 people come and try at least one prompt, with over 40,000 unique notes generated from prompts about cities all over the world.<p>We&#x27;d love for you to give Tripnotes a try and let us know what you think. The &quot;unauthed&quot; version is open to everyone. If you&#x27;re interested in using the full version, please join our waitlist.<p>The full version maintains a history of your notes and allows you to edit the text and auto-highlights any text you write&#x2F;paste in on the fly, which can be useful for pasting recommendations from friends (say via SMS or Email) and having them auto-highlighted and mapped. You can also paste in links from articles, websites, blogs, even Tiktok or Youtube. We scrape those urls, gather the list of places that are mentioned, and then show them on the map along side the rest of your note.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and feedback, so please feel free to leave a comment or reach out to us directly.

35276829,"Show HN: Hypertune – Visual, functional, statically-typed configuration language",2023-03-23T16:01:16Z,miraantabrez,16,false,false,3,"[35276889,35277080,35277088]",,,,"Hey HN! I&#x27;m Miraan, the founder at Hypertune. Hypertune lets you make your code configurable to let teammates like PMs and marketers quickly change in-app copy, feature flags, pricing plans, etc, with logic for personalization, A&#x2F;B testing and ML.<p>It&#x27;s like a CMS but instead of just letting you set static content, you can insert arbitrary logic from the UI, including A&#x2F;B tests and ML.<p>I previously built a landing page optimization tool that let marketers define variations of their headline, CTA, cover image, etc, then used a genetic algorithm to find the best combination of them. They used my Chrome extension to define changes on DOM elements based on their unique CSS selector. But this broke when the underlying page changed and didn&#x27;t work with sites that used CSS modules. Developers hated it.<p>I took a step back.<p>The problem I was trying to solve was making the page configurable by marketers in a way that developers liked. I decided to solve it from first principles and this led to Hypertune.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: You define a strongly typed configuration schema in GraphQL, e.g.<p><pre><code>  type Query {
    page(language: Language!): Page!
  }

  type Page {
    headline: String!
    imageUrl: String!
    benefits: [String!]!
  }

  enum Language { English, French, Spanish }
</code></pre>
Then marketers can configure these fields from the UI using our visual, functional, statically-typed language. The language UI is <i>type-directed</i> so we only show expression options that satisfy the required type of the hole in the logic tree. So for the &quot;headline&quot; field, you can insert a String expression or an If &#x2F; Else expression that returns a String. If you insert the latter, more holes appear. This means marketers don&#x27;t need to know any syntax and can&#x27;t get into any invalid states. They can use arguments you define in the schema like &quot;language&quot; and &quot;isReturnVisitor&quot;, and drop A&#x2F;B tests and contextual multi-armed bandits anywhere in their logic.<p>The language is <i>total</i> rather than Turing-complete so programs provably terminate. And we overlay live counts on the logic tree UI so you can see how often different branches are evaluated in real time.<p>You get your config with low latency from our Fastly edge server, which evaluates your logic given a GraphQL query. Or via the SDK which fetches your logic once on initialization (and listens for updates), then evaluates it locally — so you can use it on your backend to get content for different users immediately, without adding latency to every request. Both GraphQL and the SDK give you auto-generated code for end-to-end type-safety based on your schema.<p>The SDK supports &quot;build-time config&quot; too, where we store a snapshot of your configuration logic in your app bundle for instant initialization. This works nicely on static Jamstack sites built with Next.JS, Gatsby, etc, as we can run A&#x2F;B tests and personalization logic instantly on page load without any extra network latency.<p>I started building this for landing pages but realized it could be used for feature flags, in-app content, translations, onboarding flows, error messages, business rules, pricing plans, permissions, etc, as it&#x27;s all just &quot;code configuration&quot;.<p>Today, this configuration is hardcoded or sprawled across json&#x2F;yaml files or in separate platforms for feature flags, content, etc. So if a PM wants to A&#x2F;B test new onboarding content, they need to bother a developer to stitch their testing platform with their CMS, then wait for a code deployment. And is it even worth it at that point?<p>Our customers save time and money by buying, integrating and learning a single flexible platform rather than many separate ones.<p>We&#x27;re still figuring out the best use cases and would love your help. What would you find Hypertune most useful for? Type-safe feature flags, content management with A&#x2F;B testing, pricing plans, rules or something else? Please comment with any thoughts &#x2F; questions!",story,https://www.hypertune.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

You can generate character names, swap characters and more. It tracks the emotions and history of the chat. Chats can be saved and Sometimes it gets repetitive, but some of the conversations I&#x27;ve had are pretty hilarious.<p>---<p>*More information*<p>* My goal is to release AI tools for non-technical audiences who would like to use AI models with their own hardware.<p>* Chat AI is built using QT. I have opted to create tools that are not built with browser based GUIs. I believe the future of AI should not be cloud based.<p>* This is the second tool I have released. The first was AI Runner (which I am still actively maintaining). AI Runner is similar but works with Stable Diffusion and includes simple drawing tools, a large canvas and many more features <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capsizegames.itch.io&#x2F;ai-runner"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capsizegames.itch.io&#x2F;ai-runner</a><p>* All of this is built by one developer (myself). I also use my own products, so bugs are patched fairly quickly. I am Charging for Chat AI. I&#x27;d love to keep offering free tools, but I&#x27;m going broke.<p>* I am considering open sourcing portions of both Chat AI and AI Runner in the near future if there is interest shown.",story,https://capsizegames.itch.io/chat-ai,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
