I can talk a lot about why I&#x27;m so sold on Apple&#x27;s ecosystem, but the cynic geek inside me gets worried sometimes. Is it all a perfectly designed trap? What&#x27;s the catch?

I&#x27;m a 23 year old college dropout.<p>I used to live in the city I currently work as, but my landlord just became impossible to live with, which left me with a very bad experience of what sharing a house is like.<p>At the same time, I experienced some work problems which led me to become very anxious when I&#x27;m lonely, and so, I decided to go back to live with my parents, which has helped me become more mentally stable.<p>However, my 2.5h commute, which consists of Driving to a Train a Station (30 min) --&gt; Taking a train (1h) --&gt; Taking the subway (25 min) --&gt; Taking a tram (5 Mon) --&gt; Walk to work (5 Mon) (in the best case scenario), is making me very mentally exhausted. I wake up to go to work at 6PM and I get back home at 7.45PM. I go to sleep at 9.45PM.<p>I&#x27;ve tried listening to podcasts, but I&#x27;ve found they do not quite work for me. Maybe I need better headphones, but in the train, people just talk too loudly for them to work.<p>I cannot leave this job because it&#x27;s my sole source of income, and I&#x27;m financially stretched (salary is rather low), as well as I&#x27;m 6 months into it. Dad tells me every day how proud it is of my job and how I should never leave it.<p>Looking for a new place to rent is hell, absolute hell. Landlords want to know your work history + income history + shady landlords which do not want you to sign contracts leaving you with no rights + it would be a huge expense for me. Right now, I ride the aforementioned train for free thanks to a government program, so commuting costs me 1&#x2F;7th vs. renting.<p>I also have a friend who makes as much money as I do, in IT, WFH fully, and is doing so much better than I do.
