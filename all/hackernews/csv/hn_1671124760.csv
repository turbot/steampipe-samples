They&#x27;re already generating about 900k a year in revenue from consulting fees (which is 90% operating profit).<p>They&#x27;re basically looking for an engineer to build an MVP, which they can then iterate on + learn from in order to build a fully fledged product that they can go out an sell to their existing clients. It&#x27;s definitely a risk, but the fact that they already have relationships with these clients makes it a lot less risky.<p>My main questions is about how to get compensated as a freelancer and how much risk I&#x27;m willing to take. On one side, I don&#x27;t want it to be based fully on equity. Too much risk and I&#x27;d be taking on most of it. At the same time, I don&#x27;t want it to be all cash compensation: If this works out, I want to have equity in the business and get a constant profit stream from the product (which is what we&#x27;ve talked about).<p>Curious if anyone has any good templates for this or specific suggestions?<p>I&#x27;m mainly looking for something that:
- Is not structured around full time employment, but instead freelance type work
- Is structured around shares with profit sharing (with yearly payouts)
- Has a good balance of risk (cash vs equity)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This release includes a lot of new features, improvements and bugfixes.<p>We released the first version 6 months ago because we believe that diffing data is as fundamental of a capability as diffing code in data engineering workflows. Over the past few months, we have seen data-diff being adopted for a variety of use-cases, such as validating migration and replication of data between databases (diffing source and target) and tracking the effects of code changes on data (diffing staging&#x2F;dev and production environments).<p>With this new release data-diff is significantly faster at comparing tables within the same database, especially when there are a lot of differences between the tables. We&#x27;ve also added the ability to materialize the diff results into a database table, in addition to (or instead of) outputting them to stdout. We&#x27;ve added support for DuckDB, and for diffing schemas. Improved support for alphanumerics, and threading, and generally improved the API, the command-line interface, and stability of the tool.<p>We believe that data-diff is a valuable addition to the open source community, and we are committed to continue growing it and the community around it. We encourage you to try it out and let us know what you think!<p>You can read more about data-diff on our GitHub page at the following link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datafold&#x2F;data-diff&#x2F;<p>To see the list of changes for the 0.3.0 release, go here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datafold&#x2F;data-diff&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;v0.3.0",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
