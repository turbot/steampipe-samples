    weight 0.5

    url https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com

  person influenced person

  reference by person

</code></pre>
How would you parse the above?<p>Simple:<p>1. Split by first and last space. First element is a variable&#x2F;vertex, last element is a variable. Central &quot;was influenced by&quot; is an edge<p>2. Tabs = properties. In this case weight is a property of the connection as a whole. So you can think of it like: person_was_influenced_by_person.weight<p>So I want:<p>1. As close to English&#x2F;Python as humanly possible.<p>2. No curly braces allowed!!11111!!<p>3. No &quot;end&quot; ... no need to &quot;end&quot; in python<p>4. No *<p>5.

With that said, I found quite some helpful thoughts over the years on HN about the dark side of meditation (people needing psychiatric help basically). Even with meditation it’s not talked about a lot. But so far, I have only read one good critique on stoicism (a few months ago to a year ago?). The main point there was that stoicism is individuallistically rooted. And it can impede collaboration or building a shared vision (potentially) because of it. I wish I had the source, because the author was more nuanced.<p>It just made me wonder: what are some critiques against stoicism? I’m a fan but given it’s all hype and no challenge, I’d like some challenge",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
