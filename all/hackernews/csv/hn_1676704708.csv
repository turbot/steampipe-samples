34844586,Ask HN: Did the Fukushima cloud cause cancer?,2023-02-18T06:42:05Z,noduerme,1,false,false,,,,,,"I was living in Spain. 9 or 10 days after the meltdown, I had been tracking the cloud as it passed over the US and then over the Atlantic. As it happened, there was a major rainstorm near Granada the day it passed over. Being paranoid, I told my GF to stay downstairs and we went below. The next day everything was coated in fine yellow dust. I have seen lots of Saharan dust deposited on patios but this wasn&#x27;t the same.<p>My friend who lived next door at the time is 52 now and, this year, was just diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. Right around when he was diagnosed, I started having pretty severe shortness of breath which I attributed to &quot;long covid&quot; and haven&#x27;t checked out yet. Perhaps it&#x27;s a months-long panic attack or a sympathetic condition to my friend&#x27;s condition. But my mind keeps returning to that day with the yellow dust that dried up in droplets when the rain mixed with the Fukushima cloud that was only 9 days old.<p>What are the odds that we both sucked in some cesium during that first pass around the globe? AFAIK it hadn&#x27;t really rained out substantially anywhere before it hit Spain.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
