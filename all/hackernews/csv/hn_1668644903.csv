We posted our first product a few weeks ago.  [2] Thanks to everyone who gave feedback and tried it out.<p>We&#x27;ve been building a lot of functionality on top of Stripe and we&#x27;ve been hearing from early users about the challenges of scaling Stripe&#x27;s test mode.<p>Because you have 1 organizational account in Stripe and 1 test environment for that account, you can run in to a bunch of edge cases around how data is stored and deleted (or not). Blake wrote a separate post about those issues here [3].<p>We were excited to build this feature and write about it because we have gotten tired of making fake accounts which become hard to track because we&#x27;re never sure what state each account is in.<p>Tier switch lets you spin up ephemeral test environments and you can instantly access them. It feels a lot more like a Netlify or Vercel deployment preview. This is nice when you are creating new Stripe backed features but they aren&#x27;t in your main branch yet and you want to avoid polluting the test account that other members of your team might be using.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty specific itch to scratch, but it has been one we&#x27;ve seen ourselves and heard about from a few others. Hopefully it will be useful to you too at some point.<p>1: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tierrun&#x2F;tier"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tierrun&#x2F;tier</a>
