Now, I&#x27;m using i3wm for a few years. day-by-day tasks that i do are in different projects and contexts like coding in some project (witch totally not related), researching a topic, recording a podcast and etc. I need switching between them frequently. Like many others, I use workspace feature, few workspace for each context. To give you an idea, three workspace for coding, two others for searching, and ... . 
Its fine and works, but I prefer to have totally isolated environment and switching between them. I mean totally isolated suppose that I want open browser separately in each env. 
I tried this by running two or more i3 instance in two different TTY; But there are some issues on second tty. For example when i open Firefox in TTY2, it will open a new browser in TTY1 instead TTY2.
Is there any best-practice, window manager, or hack to have this?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
