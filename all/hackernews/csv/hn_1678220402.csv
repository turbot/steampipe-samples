35060088,Show HN: Improve essay writing skills with ChatGPT,2023-03-07T19:37:46Z,Timrael,3,false,false,,,,,,"Hey there folks, today I want to share with you how I came up with a ChatGPT-based service to improve essay writing skills, particularly for tests like PTE (Person Test of English) and IELTS.<p>Now, let me just say upfront that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of writing essays. But I know that practice makes perfect, so I force myself to write them every day in the hopes that they&#x27;ll eventually become easier. However, one of the biggest challenges I face is that I don&#x27;t always get immediate feedback on my writing. I have a weekly call with my English teacher, which is great, but it means that I have to wait to get feedback on my mistakes. And in the meantime, I keep making the same errors over and over again, which can be frustrating and slow down my progress.<p>That&#x27;s where ChatGPT comes in. After some experimentation with prompt engineering, I discovered the one that allows me to get instant feedback on my writing. The AI checks things like structure, complexity, vocabulary, and so on, meaning that the main problem was solved.<p>But that&#x27;s not all. I also realized that ChatGPT could help me take my writing skills to the next level. One day, I was curious to know how a native English speaker would express my thoughts. How close was I to perfect English writing? So I fed my essay into ChatGPT, explained how the perfect essay should be written, asked it to rewrite it as a native speaker would, and saved the meaning at the same time. And let me tell you, I was blown away by the level of English that ChatGPT produced.<p>I put these 2 features (personalized feedback and rewritten essay) into the website and now I am asking for your feedback. There is no need to sign up, just put an essay, and press the button.",story,https://ptewithai.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35060325,Tell HN: Access to AWS and Amazon.com is now independent,2023-03-07T19:56:06Z,cj,1,false,false,,,,,,"Was ecstatic to see this email from AWS. TLDR: AWS root logins used to be irreversibly tied to Amazon.com retail accounts (same password).<p>I made a huge fuss with AWS 5 years ago to make it possible to separate retail and AWS accounts, and they finally did it.<p>Huge pain point solved for founders who started companies signing up for AWS using their retail account, and later need to separate the root account (until this week, it wasn’t possible)<p>Sharing the email since I can’t find an official announcement.<p>—<p>Greetings from Amazon Web Services,<p>In the past, you have used the same email address and password to sign in to Amazon.com and AWS. In response to customer feedback, AWS is updating your account to make your access to Amazon.com and AWS independent. You can continue using this email address and your current password to sign in to Amazon.com. However, the next time that you sign in to AWS, you will be prompted to create a new password and will have the option to register a new multi-factor authentication (MFA) device. MFA is a best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your email and password.<p>AWS will never email you and ask you to disclose your password. You will see the prompts to create a new password and register a new MFA device only when you visit the AWS Console at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;console.aws.amazon.com which will direct you to our secure sign-in experience hosted on the signin.aws subdomain.<p>This update to your AWS account also gives you the option to secure your AWS sign-in with additional MFA device types such as hardware security keys [1]. In addition, this update can help you monitor root user activity with AWS CloudTrail at no additional cost [2].<p>[1] To learn more about the types of MFA supported on AWS, visit our AWS IAM MFA User Guide: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;IAM&#x2F;latest&#x2F;UserGuide&#x2F;id_credentials_mfa.html<p>[2] To learn more about about monitoring sign-in events to the Console, visit our AWS CloudTrail User Guide: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;awscloudtrail&#x2F;latest&#x2F;userguide&#x2F;cloudtrail-event-reference-aws-console-sign-in-events.html",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
