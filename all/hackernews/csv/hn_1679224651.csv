Of course, people are paid each year more because software is always evolving and with each passing day the way you code evolves.<p>Let&#x27;s say if you are an employer, one of the big tech companies with over 10 thousand software engineers, a 10% annual raise is no small amount, and when you factor in compounding, in a couple of years your overhead costs rise really fast.<p>However, if you lay off 10% of your whole workforce, you don&#x27;t just save the salary cuts, but you also save an even way bigger amount which is in bonuses and salary growth expectations for the remainder of the company.<p>During a downturn, when people are losing jobs, others are happy to just have a job, even if they don&#x27;t get a raise.<p>In the company I work for, people already started fearfully asking if they will get a full bonus for the last year. Even though the company achieved record profits, they cite market conditions, and employees got scared.<p>Pavlov conditioning at its finest.<p>Is there even something we can do, except try to weather the storm?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
