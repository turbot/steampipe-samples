35135438,The New OpenAI tokenizer for the Turbo model is much better than the GPT-2/3 one,2023-03-13T13:29:00Z,Tiberium,6,false,false,2,"[35135597,35135573]",,,,"The new gpt-3.5-turbo model by OpenAI uses the new cl100k_base tokenizer. I used the tiktoken Python library to get the list (code - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rentry.org&#x2F;qghpf), and some of the results are very interesting.
There are a lot of tokens that are used for indentation (multiple spaces), which is much better for code than GPT-2 which always had spaces as separate tokens - in longer code examples the token savings can be 2x compared to GPT-2 tokenizer.<p>The longest token out of them all is 58040, which is a string of 128 spaces. There are tokens for strings with 1 to 81 spaces, also for 83, 87, 91, 95 and as mentioned 128 spaces.<p>The longest non-space token 87644 is &quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&quot; with 114 characters.<p>The longest non-symbol token is 63570 - &quot;.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints&quot; (from Apple&#x27;s UIView).

Also some interesting ones - &quot; &quot;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x2F;&quot; (the quote inside is from the token itself)<p>If you want to see all tokens sorted by their byte length - see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;Yardanico&#x2F;623b3092d0b707119f8c7d90a3596afe (warning: 1.6MB of text, 100k+ lines)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
