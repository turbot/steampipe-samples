35271284,Show HN: Nousb.co – A seamless multi-platform ephemeral file transfer webapp,2023-03-23T06:54:12Z,stant,4,false,false,,,,,,"Key technical point is that it does NOT rely on webRTC<i>, which is not reliable enough on all browsers, and there are important file system APIs (ie. `showSaveFilePicker`) that are missing on most browsers to do actual file transfers, without storing the whole file in RAM first.<p>The idea is to have something that is as multi-platform as possible, and can work on all browsers, even the embedded webviews in chat apps. And without app installation or account creation.<p>To test it with a common case, which is transferring between a smartphone and a laptop:<p>- Open <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;NoUSB.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;NoUSB.co</a>
- Click the &quot;Share link&quot; button.
- Scan the QR code with your phone or transfer the link to another computer.
- Drag and drop large files; they&#x27;ll instantly appear on the other side, regardless of size.
- Click the download button on the receiving device.
- Click the &quot;Boost this!&quot; button to unlock more transfer speed.
- Close the tab and all sharing stop instantly<p>Multiple devices can join the same virtual drive and share their own files.<p>There&#x27;s also a chat feature because if you click a sharing link from a messenger app, you will certainly end up trapped in their embedded webview with no way to get back to chat without disconnecting.<p>For more technical details: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;stant&#x2F;nousbco-yet-another-file-transfer-tool-but-better-or-is-it-3i1o"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;stant&#x2F;nousbco-yet-another-file-transfer-tool-...</a><p>Please test it and let me know how it went for you.
Thanks!<p></i>webRTC is actually implemented as an experimental feature, you&#x27;ll need to add `&amp;rtc=1` on both sides to enable it. Only chrome based browsers that implement `showSaveFilePicker` can be the downloading end.",story,https://NoUSB.co,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Inspired by Ted Chiang&#x27;s &quot;The Lifecycle of Software Objects,&quot; I envision AI companions that learn and grow with their users, acting as personal assistants, tutors, or friends.<p>My plan is to use an open-source LLM like Meta&#x27;s Llama or Stanford&#x27;s Alpaca, host it on a personal server or low-cost cloud service, and fine-tune it based on conversation history and user feedback.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate your thoughts on:<p><pre><code>  - Feasibility and potential challenges.
  - Best practices for fine-tuning LLMs and effective feedback mechanisms.
  - Ideas for user-friendly interfaces that encourage interaction.
  - Ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and potential biases in the learning process.
  - Relevant experiences or resources you&#x27;d recommend.
