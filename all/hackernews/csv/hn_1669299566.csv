33731137,Ask HN: How to litigate a big company over IP,2022-11-24T13:35:21Z,g_combinator,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi all!
Ten years ago me and my friend helped a very small startup create an MVP of their product. I worked on this for half a year and I&#x27;ve basically set up and architectured the product from scratch.<p>After we worked on it for half a year the company ran out of money and stopped working with us. Some time later my friend continued working with them from time to time but I did not. Product gained some traction and 3 years later was sold to a very big company, basically and industry leader. Founders made a lot of money and my friend was asked to sign the release documents for this big company which he did. I was not asked and didn&#x27;t sign anything.
The big company turned out to be a little bit crazy over IP and non-solicitation and later sued the founders of our product over some bullshit, but this isn&#x27;t related to my case. They killed the product development last year, immediately firing around 20 people working on it leaving only a couple of developers and a manager to support existing clients.<p>Anyway, the big company is still using the product based on the code I wrote (they still have my commits in their repository) and since I never signed away any intellectual property rights I believe I have a claim to IP in the product. I come from a country where litigation over IP is very uncommon and I have absolutely no idea how to proceed with this case. The big company is based in US, I&#x27;m currently in Europe. What are my options here? Is there any lawyer companies that specialize in cases like this and they can look into it?<p>I would appreciate any suggestions.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
