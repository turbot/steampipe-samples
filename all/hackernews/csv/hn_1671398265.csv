- how to transfer video to&#x2F;from different resolutions without it getting messed up— A laptop to a vhs, a vhs to a laptop (I have been using vidbox but wish it could look better).

  -easily embed code and context in the tweet equivalent. Would be awesome to have formatted, maybe even runnable, code snippets

  -twitter spaces for developers that includes code or screen sharing and ways to bring people &quot;on stage&quot; to not just talk but multiplayer control or share another window to the space to show what they&#x27;re working on or explain a concept together and answer questions (twitch streaming with more dev focused integrations)
