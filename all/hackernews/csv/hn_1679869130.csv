My girlfriend, Julia, has been pursuing her dream of becoming a UX&#x2F;UI designer for almost a year now while working in logistics, and today she has finally published her first project!<p>I can&#x27;t express how proud I am of her for putting in the hard work to make her dream a reality. It&#x27;s not easy to balance work and study (you know, sleepless nights to chase a dream), but she has done it with great determination.<p>Now that Julia has completed her first project, she&#x27;s excited to take the next step in her journey and is actively searching for job opportunities in UX&#x2F;UI design. If any of you have any leads or know of any open positions in this field, we would be immensely grateful for any advice or guidance you can offer.<p>I know some of you may think it&#x27;s a small feat, but to us, it&#x27;s a significant accomplishment worth toasting. As a community of innovators and dreamers, I hope we can all take inspiration from Julia&#x27;s story and strive to follow our passions relentlessly.<p>Let&#x27;s raise a glass to Julia and all the aspiring designers out there who are working hard to turn their dreams into reality. Cheers!<p>Her project published on Behance: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.behance.net&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;166920067&#x2F;TagPalette-UXUI-Design",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
