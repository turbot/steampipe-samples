33761192,Ask HN: How to deal with multiple working languages in the workplace?,2022-11-27T07:36:19Z,hxugufjfjf,3,false,false,1,[33761273],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I am a non-leader position a IT security consultancy company in a country in Europe. Our department is around 35 people, where about half is now hired from around Europe and the US, and have moved here. I am from this country, and English education is decent here, so we have all defaulted to (broken) English as the working language. However, we currently have the following challenges:
- What should be our working language? English, or should everybody have to learn the native language? Those that would, will not be able to have a technical discussion with a customer or write a report in the language for probably 1-2 years anyway.
- The native english speakers in the department have a major advance language wise, and &quot;eat us up&quot; in technical discussions, because most of us non-native english speakers can&#x27;t convey the same arguments as fluently as them.
- Non-native english and non-native struggle with not being fluent in either of the working languages.
- Serious department discussions and meetings in (broken) English often lead to confusion and misunderstandings. We&#x27;ve seen an significant increase in personnel conflicts primarily because of poor use of language, or misunderstandings of it. And several remain unresolved because we in reality are working with 5-10 different languages and cultures.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
