If we are to consider this, is there any future in which the humans race does not choke itself with its own overgrowth?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Needless to say I forward immediately and removed the extension.<p>I didn&#x27;t get the chance to share it then and I happened to think about it today. Went ahead and re-installed the extension to make sure its still the case and no surprises it is.<p>I think this won&#x27;t come as a big surprise as to my knowledge you.com is vc-backed so that is something one would most likely anticipate in such scenarios. 
Thought I share that as it might be interesting to know for people using the engine&#x2F;extension.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
