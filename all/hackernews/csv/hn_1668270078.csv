I’ve been working on a way to make AI generated art more practical (and tactile). BadBotDesign is an early version of a generative shirt tool using a few custom versions of Stable Diffusion + up-resolution to make the designs ready to print on products. You enter a prompt and then can get a high quality soft shirt delivered straight to your door with whatever image you create. You can also order other people’s prompts. I’ve actually really enjoyed wearing some of the random designs random people have made so far.
If people like it enough, it could be fun to continue adding features like better variations and styles, as well as more products, and maybe it could make sense to let people sell their prompts here and get royalties on sales or something? Anyway, any suggestions would be appreciated!",story,https://www.badbotdesign.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

No reading, searching, user profiles, or any other feature.<p>+ Users too just want it to post. We can assume many users don&#x27;t want any apps - including this one - to routinely examine their user profiles, followers, or protected memberships on the platform.<p>+ However - and here&#x27;s the problem IMO - the API&#x27;s &#x2F;post endpoint <i>forces</i> the app to have &quot;read readuser post&quot; scopes just to call this post-only API. (&quot;Scopes&quot; are OAuth terminology for broad permissions).<p>Why <i>I</i> think this is bad design:<p>+ The API fails to differentiate between <i>external</i> access and <i>internal</i>  access. If the API&#x27;s code needs to read profile data before posting, it&#x27;s purely an <i>internal implementation detail</i>. There&#x27;s no need to impose that requirement on all external apps even when they aren&#x27;t interested in reading that data.<p>+ This is a leaky abstraction but with long-term privacy implications. Every posting app now has access to data it doesn&#x27;t need or want. The app&#x27;s vulnerabilities, breaches, or ownership transfers can potentially breach private data of thousands of users.<p>The OAuth philosophy normally assumes that apps have malicious intentions and it&#x27;s on the platform to look out for the best interests of its users.<p>Ironically, here it&#x27;s the API owner itself that&#x27;s ignoring user privacy and the spirit of user consent. Perhaps an unintended consequence of innocuous technical decisions made by individual engineers who didn&#x27;t realize their higher-level implications 
on society.<p>But I haven&#x27;t done API design at that scale. I made this an Ask instead of Tell HN because I&#x27;d like to know:<p>1) Do you think this is poor API design? Or is there a Chesterton&#x27;s Fence here that I&#x27;m overlooking that justifies the broader scopes?<p>2) If you think it&#x27;s poor design, do you know of any online resources for authz best practices that you found useful?<p>3) Are there terms and phrases for such phenomena where innocuous decisions made at lower levels, perhaps under limited time and responsibilities, have wider and deeper implications?<p>----<p>The particular API I&#x27;m talking about (though I believe this may be a wider problem across most platforms): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.twitter.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;twitter-api&#x2F;tweets&#x2F;manage-tweets&#x2F;api-reference&#x2F;post-tweets",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
