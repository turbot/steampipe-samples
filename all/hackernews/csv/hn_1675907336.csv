I glance at this content through the day, or, more often, I close out the tabs without really looking at them closely.<p>Occasionally I (believe I) have something useful to add to a comment thread, but my reply attempts are met with the noprocrast nag screen.<p>Thing is, at least for me, writing a reply isn&#x27;t the target behavior for noprocrast. Refreshing for updates is. EG, the harmful behavior is compulsive read refreshes, not writing. If my experience is typical, then allowing the reply link during noprocrast would be a sensible default. If my experience is atypical, then it might be a nice configuration option.<p>Just think! You&#x27;d get to read more of my wonderful comments!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
