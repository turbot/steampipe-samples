The Connector can even enroll and authenticate new customers for you on the fly while supporting a customizable account-linking flow backed by the financial APIs of your choice.<p>Before joining Quiltt, I worked on two fintech startups, Aquila &amp; Chime, focusing on enrolling and onboarding customers through processes like KYC and syncing banking data for underwriting. While in my spare time, I would use this same tech to make it easier to manage my finances, But every time, it was a process of setting up a lot of plumbing and then dealing with API changes and disconnections. While each business was very different, I had to solve these problems repeatedly while trying to make it easy for end-users to onboard complex and sensitive data into these financial products. It made it hard to focus on the issues that matter to the customers.<p>With Quiltt Connector, we make it easy to onboard and collect the customer&#x27;s financial profile so that you can focus on building the features that make your product different.<p>With 1-line of code, you can start onboarding users into your application, giving you access to an easy-to-use GraphQL API that allows you to query for the data the way you want it.<p>Try it out now at: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quiltt.io&#x2F;product&#x2F;connector"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quiltt.io&#x2F;product&#x2F;connector</a><p>With a modular design, we can support the entire range of integrations from the No-Code Prototype to full API access for your engineers, Allowing you to grow the depth of your integration as needed.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback on Quiltt Connector. Please feel free to ask any questions or leave comments below. I, Zane (sirwolfgang), the Lead Engineer, supported by Ruben (rubendinho), our Technical Founder and CEO, will be around to answer questions.<p>Thanks for checking it out!<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quiltt.io&#x2F;product&#x2F;connector"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quiltt.io&#x2F;product&#x2F;connector</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;quiltt-connector"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;quiltt-connector</a>",story,https://www.quiltt.io/product/connector,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34883423,Ask HN: How do I get back into the tech industry after 4 years of unemployment?,2023-02-21T16:56:06Z,troutskey,12,false,false,3,"[34883736,34883724,34883747,34883712]",,,,"Hello,<p>4 years ago I felt burnt out and decided to take a short break in order to reassess my career. I simply hadn&#x27;t realised how much my health had deteriorated and that led to what ballooned into a 4 year long convalescence. I finally feel physically capable of returning to work but worry that I&#x27;m no longer competent enough, not even in the kind of roles I used to work at (primarily web-related backend along with some system and network administration).<p>A few questions I have are:<p>1. What should I do to get to a point where I feel confident enough to actually send in applications? (I have never really been any good at LeetCode-type problems and have no personal projects to speak of.)<p>2. Will the 4-year gap and my choppy CV be a major hindrance to my hirability? (My employement history consists of 2 years at a consulting firm and 3 short startup stints of &lt;1 year each.) If yes, how do I minimise its debilitating effects?<p>3. I feel like I have the best chance of getting hired in the kind of roles I used to work at and those are the ones I&#x27;m interested in as well but in doing so am I restricting myself to a limited number of positions? Should I be spending my time in expanding my knowledge areas? (Although I feel like I know too little of anything else to ever feel confident enough to apply for an actual paid position in those roles.)<p>4. Is my timing bad? Is the current climate not well suited for someone like me to get back into the industry (though I have a feeling that no climate would be conducive to someone in my position.)<p>To add: I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have an undergraduate degree. Financially, I have a comfortable 1 year runway or a 1.5 year runway at a pinch. So I can&#x27;t afford to go back to school; a bootcamp I could attend (as long as it&#x27;s remote) but I&#x27;m not really sure how good they usually are.<p>Many thanks to anyone who takes the time to respond.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
34883539,Show HN: Open-source alternative to Fig and Warp,2023-02-21T17:03:58Z,iondodon,1,false,false,1,[34883563],,,,"This project aims to create a terminal with functionalities that improve the experience of using terminals. The project uses technologies such as Svelte on the front-end, which offers flexibility regarding the implementation of the interface. On the back-end side, the most important part is the PTY. All the back end is implemented in Rust. The basic framework of the project is Tauri.<p>At the moment the terminal has autocomplete suggestions for some commands (cd, ls, mvn). To support more commands it is needed to add them in the Manter&#x27;s &quot;library&quot; located at src&#x2F;cli&#x2F;library&#x2F;library.ts. It is possible to have custom script based suggestions. For example if we write in the terminal “git checkout” and after we press Space, a dropdown will appear with all available branches.<p>A good analogy to understand the purpose of this project is the following - traditional terminals are like simple code editors while this terminal is like an IDE.<p>Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project with and ideas. Imagine the terminal you would like to use. Feel free to open any issue with suggestions and bugs.<p>See in the comments the link to the Manter project.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
