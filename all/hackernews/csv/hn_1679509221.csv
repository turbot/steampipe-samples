We&#x27;re the team at @ Bemi and we&#x27;re looking for feedback on our tooling that eases engineering onboarding at companies.<p>From our experience as devs, we found that the early days at a company were critical and are surprised that there&#x27;s not more tooling available specifically for engineering onboarding. During this time, devs are typically the most motivated, most open to feedback, receptive to learning- so it makes it an important time to form a strong foundation for their future success at the company. 
From speaking to lots of engineers, we find this period also strongly correlates with retention - for a dev joining a new job can be overwhelming (new codebase, lots of new tools, business logic, new product), a positive experience here can go a long way to make them feel welcome and valued. But curious what the HN community thinks!<p>We&#x27;re quite early stage so some of the waitlist page material is purposely vague currently. Please give any and all feedback!

Data analytics &#x2F; Business insights team you&#x27;re part of has somewhere between 5 and 20 people. Daily, you get questions from other departments for custom reports, dashboards and quick answers. Some of it is part of a bigger project that takes months and results in comprehensive dashboards, some of it is ad-hoc and will never be needed again, but you usually don&#x27;t know if some simple quick question will turn into a bigger thing. However, in all of these cases, most of the actual &quot;work&quot; is about writing, rewriting, modifying and maintaining SQL code.<p>My question is: how do you manage all that code? Is there a git repo where you follow some nice structure you defined? Do you build everything in DBT? Do you use fancy tools like Metabase? Do you store it in your data warehouse itself (e.g. as a stored procedure or view)? Do you just write the code and then throw it out because, the next time you need something like this, database would have changed anyway (or a completely new one will become the main source of data), so it makes no sense to even store it?<p>I&#x27;m intentionally not specifying the &quot;stack&quot; here, as I&#x27;d like to hear what actually works well, not what is just the least-bad option for a particular tech stack.<p>I&#x27;m especially happy to hear from people who have had bad experiences with whatever they chose to do, as I&#x27;m in the process of trying to solve this problem for my team and would really like to avoid as many mistakes as possible.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

You need some revenue to operate a company, but you can do it by charging customers a monthly fee and keep money as is without investing it anywhere and do not provide deposit&#x2F;loans services, just storing your money and providing money transfer services (wire, checks, debit cards). Is it just eventually any company would love to earn more, so they invest it in some assets thus increasing the risk or something else?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
