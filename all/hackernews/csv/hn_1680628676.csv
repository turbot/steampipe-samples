35442355,Show HN: Interval 1.0 – Build complete tools with just back end code,2023-04-04T16:40:07Z,alexarena,7,false,false,,,,,,"Hey HN,<p>My name is Alex and I founded Interval [0]. We let you build complete internal tools with just backend code. Today we’re excited to launch our 1.0 release.<p>We built Interval for engineers who love writing code but hate building UIs. Because you build tools with Interval using just backend code (TypeScript&#x2F;Node or Python), you can focus on what you love – writing the code that makes your tools work – while Interval takes care of the UI, network communication, validation, etc.<p>Back in June, we shared an early preview of Interval on HN [1] and while our core approach hasn’t changed, we’ve learned a lot and expanded what Interval can do significantly.<p>A single line of Interval code can now (for example) render a table, prompt a user to verify their identity w&#x2F; 2FA, or ask them to upload a file.<p>Here’s an example of a line of Interval code that you might see in the wild:
`const profilePicture = await io.input.file(‘Upload a new profile picture for the user’)`<p>When that line is reached inside of an Interval action, as your code awaits:<p>- A file upload dropzone component is rendered to the person using your tool<p>- The work of transferring the selected file over the network is handled for you<p>…and when `profilePicture` is returned, you have a soundly-typed object with everything you need including the file name, size in bytes, and its contents as a Buffer.<p>It’s a subtle unlock, but because all of the code you’re writing is backend code, it becomes much quicker to build tools with Interval vs. anything else we’ve seen before. You can do things like query your database on one line and then pass the results into a table for the user to view on the next.<p>And if you integrate Interval into your existing backend, you can take advantage of everything in your preferred stack. For example, we use Prisma as the ORM in our main app and reuse the same instance in our internal tools with no additional work.<p>All of this means you can build a lot with Interval with remarkably little effort. Over the past few months, it’s been common for us to see teams spin up complete admin dashboards or customer support tools in hours instead of days or weeks.<p>To give you a better idea of what Interval is capable of, we’ve pulled together some more examples on our site. [2] My favorite one so far is a _complete_ tool to ask questions about any Postgres database in plain English, implemented with Interval, the pg Node library, and OpenAI in &lt;80 lines of code.<p>So that’s Interval. I’m excited to hear what you think + answer any questions. And if you want to start building, our SDKs are available now for JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript and Python.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interval.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interval.com</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31656496"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31656496</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interval.com&#x2F;#examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interval.com&#x2F;#examples</a>",story,https://interval.com/launch,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We&#x27;re building an AI-first document editor that helps you write. It&#x27;s similar to Notion, but focused on building a solid authoring experience.<p>Here’s a general demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MpK9PWo0lUw"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MpK9PWo0lUw</a><p>And here’s a demo that includes math and code blocks: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type.ai&#x2F;code-math-demos"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type.ai&#x2F;code-math-demos</a><p>There are a lot of AI writing products out now, but we&#x27;ve found that most of them treat writing like a one-shot activity that should be delegated to AI. We don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the optimal way to write. We think of great writing as the product of clear thinking, which requires a lot of time tinkering with and refining ideas. So we’re building a user-friendly document editor that puts the author front and center.<p>As you write in Type, you can press cmd+k to summon simple AI commands. Most of our commands are grounded in familiar writing primitives (ex. “Write paragraph”) and attempt to understand the context of your document.<p>Type supports multiple rich block types, including code and math and our commands are able to both interpret and output these block types. So if you&#x27;re writing an introductory essay about machine learning, for example, you can use Type&#x27;s chat feature to generate and refine equations and code blocks you&#x27;d like to include in your document. Once you’re satisfied with what Type has generated, you can drag and insert the block anywhere in your document (as seen in the demo video above).<p>We’ve also built a &quot;what to write about next&quot; feature in the document sidebar that offers suggestions on ideas you may consider adding to your document.<p>We’ve built some editor features that aren’t AI-specific but which we think make for an enjoyable authoring experience: (1) Type is built from the ground up to be offline-first. This means most interactions (search, loading documents, etc.) are instant; (2) Mobile support as installable PWA; (3) Keyboard shortcuts for the most useful commands; (4) Markdown copy&#x2F;paste support.<p>We designed Type to be most useful for longer-form writing, so we encourage you to try it out in the context of something like an essay or a technical tutorial. If you try it out at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type.ai"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type.ai</a>, we’d love to hear what you think. We think Type feels pretty different from other AI writing tools that produce fairly shallow content, but would love to get your honest feedback on whether we&#x27;re hitting the mark.<p>Each account comes with a free allocation of AI commands, after which you can activate a paid plan for unlimited AI usage (you can still create and access unlimited docs on the free plan). If you&#x27;d like some additional free credits, please just drop us a note at founders@type.ai and we&#x27;ll refill your free credits.<p>We&#x27;d love your feedback on what feels helpful and what feels confusing or missing.
