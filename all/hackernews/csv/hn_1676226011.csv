34764837,Ask HN: How can I recover my hacked Facebook account?,2023-02-12T17:37:10Z,alexhackney,1,false,false,,[34764960],,,,"I&#x27;ve had my Facebook account for about 15 years. During that time I&#x27;ve had different email addresses and one of them was on a domain name I let go more that 5 years ago.<p>I had 2fa enabled and had never had an issue with my account. I had also spent more than 10k on ads in the last year or so for my video business.<p>In November, someone registered that old domain name and used it to access an email account that was still on my account. Even though I had 2fa enabled and had not logged in to facebook with that email in years, they were able to get in.<p>They ran some ads, applied for an increase in ad spend and get my account banned for community violations.<p>I&#x27;ve done everything I can think of from filling out the forms and submitting my Drivers License to even sending them a registered overnight letter. I can not get anyone to help me recover my account.<p>I had some apps setup that allowed FB login for customers to my business site and then I had an app for oauth to handle streaming for customers as well. Both of those are obviously on hold as well as the facebook pages for our businesses.<p>Is there anything that can be done at this point or do I just write facebook off? I personally didn&#x27;t use it much for social stuff, but it was pretty crucial to my career and business still.<p>I&#x27;m really frustrated about this and if it wasnt for the fact that so many people still use it, I would just drop it.<p>I created another account the other day but I had to upload my DL to verify the account for development and now that one is banned too. I thought I had everything locked down pretty tight but I guess that domain name was the fatal blow.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
