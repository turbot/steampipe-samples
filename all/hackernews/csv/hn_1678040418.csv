(2) There is not an easy way (afaik) to audit which changes were made in this manner or why they were made.

Last night, the group was &quot;hacked&quot; along with other groups sharing the same administrator. It seems the Whatsapp account of said administrator was compromised. I think the most likely explanation is that the administrator ran a script on his browser console to automate some task, and that this script turned out to be a malware that stole his session. I&#x27;m not talking about high-profile people here, so it is unlikely that someone would invest resources in a more sophisticated attack. Is there a more likely explanation?<p>This may seem like a somewhat banal question. But the most concerning aspect of this situation is of a more social nature. The affected people immediately start to draw conclusions about individuals they regard as unfriendly misfits. In two such incidents the &quot;misfits&quot; have been suffering from mental illness (one was in fact hospitalized when the incident occurred more than a year ago). People just start connecting unrelated dots about other recent instances of &quot;hacking&quot; with their limited information, and end up submitting vulnerable persons to further ostracism.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
