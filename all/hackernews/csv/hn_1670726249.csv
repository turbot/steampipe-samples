What are the chances we were selected not because of any of the stated reasons such as restructuring, but instead because our remaining equity grant was more valuable than the company wanted to pay out?

Most professions, even ones that look wildly different, live under the umbrella of “Understanding how people respond to incentives, how to convincingly solve their problems, and how to work with others who are difficult to communicate with and&#x2F;or disagree with you.” Once you see the roots shared by most fields you realize there’s a sink of information you’ve been ignoring that can help you make better sense of your own profession. I didn’t appreciate how important communication is to providing investment advice before reading about how many doctors struggle to communicate effectively with patients, leading to patients who don’t stick with treatment plans and are resistant to lifestyle change. There are millions of these dots to connect. Probing beyond the confines of your day job is more fun anyways.&quot;<p>Wonder if anyone has any practical cases or examples of how are you applying learning from multiple disciplines or industries?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
