35196999,Ask HN: Remote jobs in areas outside US (Central America),2023-03-17T13:48:03Z,neteyes,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi!<p>I posted before that me and my partner are planning to move to Central America, or Panama specifically, from Europe, to her home country. You helped with some great resources, and I&#x27;m working on growing my network in that area, as well as signing up with the remote consultant matchmakers and hopefully I&#x27;ll find something so we can make the plan a reality!<p>Now I&#x27;m trying to find the same for my partner, but it&#x27;s proving difficult. She knows Spanish of course, but I think we would both prefer to work remotely. She&#x27;s a BIM Architect&#x2F;Coordinator&#x2F;Manager, and I have to be honest, it&#x27;s difficult even finding postings for architect jobs these days, much less remote ones, because the market is totally saturated with postings of &quot;.NET Architect&quot;, &quot;Node.js Architect&quot;, &quot;System Architect&quot;.<p>Anyway, from what I can tell, most remote opportunities are &quot;remote&quot;, one day a week at the office, or &quot;remote&quot; within the city&#x2F;state in the US. Most companies are also requiring you to have citizenship or be located in the US.<p>Her experiences with working for latin American companies in the past are horrible. As she describes it, people are more interested in screwing over your neighbour to get ahead, than to do the job, it&#x27;s a toxic environment with bullying and nastiness. So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re looking for remote.<p>She&#x27;s worked with US based companies in the past, and has experience with the architectural processes at least in some states in the US, but again, we can&#x27;t live there.<p>Long rant over, my question is if there&#x27;s any resources similar to those for systems developers, companies that specialise in hiring architects or BIM people located in latin America for remote positions? I&#x27;d like to build a professional network for both of us before moving there.
As you can imagine, Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Weworkremotely etc. are mostly focused on development roles and related administrative positions, and then architecture jobs disappear in the mass of tech.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
