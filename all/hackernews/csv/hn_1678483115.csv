The email contains a link to their LinkedIn profile and a real link to the the job as posted on the careers section of the company. However, the sender’s return email address has a domain of &lt;company_name&gt;.careers. The root domain is .careers and the pattern is &lt;firstname&gt;@&lt;companyname&gt;.careers. It seemed odd to me but I figured this was just a secondary domain of the company. I replied to this email only to get a boilerplate response a week later which basically said “thank you for responding we will get back to you” and then I was ghosted.<p>Most recently, I received another email with a very similar pattern, but different enough to be unique. It was verbose and felt very much something like ChatGPT would create.<p>I have many questions. At best, it might be genuine. At worst, it’s a job farming operation by an unscrupulous recruiter impersonating the real executive through the clever use of a .careers domain.
