When something is flagged, it could go into a &quot;controversial fight&quot; where people debate whether it deserves moderation or not. Karma could be earned double for participating in moderation activities, to encourage people to use the feature. But it&#x27;s more like a community involved thing. Alternately, mod teams could be elected paid positions and up for reelection yearly using ranked choice voting. It might be a cool opportunity to experience ranked choice voting on a wide scale.<p>Another option might be to use AI to categorize every post based on political leanings (e.g. center left, center right, left field, right field, neutral&#x2F;apolitical). Profiles could act as a link tree of their own, and potentially even as an aggregator for imported online activity (e.g. RSS feeds, Facebook posts, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.).<p>In this politically polarized world, it&#x27;s hard to predict what the next iteration of social media will look like.

Tax regulations allow for sub $1,000 purchases to be written off immediately, and I have had an okay year, so I am wondering if there are any work-related purchases you made that turned out to be a fantastic decision, and&#x2F;or something you can highly recommend.<p>Especially interested in things that turned out to be surprisingly worth the purchase.<p>----------<p>Things I&#x27;ve purchased that were absolutely worth it:<p>CalDigit TS3 Plus<p>A VESA monitor mount (even though the monitor came with a stand, it still made a huge difference having the flexible arm, and a clean desk underneath it).<p>The Sony XM4s are fantastic, I wish the mic would be video-call worthy, but it isn&#x27;t.<p>The Awair air quality monitor (although I am hearing a lot of terrible things about the company and their misguided crypto sidequest).<p>An USB3 HDMI frame grabber off Amazon. I use this to plug in any kind of external device (incl. laptops with other operating systems on it) when I am teaching and need to share a workflow off a Windows PC or vice-versa.<p>A Magsafe puck (I was hell-bent never to buy one), combined with a desk-stand that houses it. It is actually insanely nice to just drop the phone onto this and pick it up and never worry about plugging in&#x2F;out.<p>A super long (4-5m?, ~15 feet) USB-C cable. I bring this anywhere I go, it&#x27;s so nice to plug in and not have to sit by the wall waiting for a charge-up.<p>Edit: Herman Miller Aeron. Even though I sometimes feel a bit annoyed by the chair forcing me how to sit a certain way when I want to sit in another way, I have sat on every single office chair I came across and within seconds realised that they&#x27;re inferior to the Aeron.<p>Things I felt were okay, but didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations:<p>Logitech Brio 4k (camera seems ok, software is a disaster and as soon as you go for manual exposure, the frame rate drops to about a frame a second).<p>Yubikey (this will cause some drama here), I should have bought two, only got one to try it out, but have never used it after setting it up. I worry too much (still) that I mess up and I lose access to important stuff. Still looking for a good top-tier use-case for it (not into crypto).<p>Sketchapp. This is a while back, but they kept pumping out new versions so quickly, I felt like it would&#x27;ve been better to go straight to Figma or similar at the time.<p>A medium-sized brightness&#x2F;color-temp adjustable battery-operated light panel off Amazon for video calls. Wearing glasses, it&#x27;s impossible to use as a direct light, so best I can do is illuminate a nearby white wall and use it as an indirect light. Battery life went from several hours to half an hour in less about a year, so not particularly happy with it.<p>Samsung Frame TV: This was mostly for my home, but I was hoping to use it for work occasionally. It&#x27;s amazing to me just how poor the TV experience still is, in 2022. Crashes often, minimal configurability, the ambient&#x2F;digital picture frame feature is so gimmicky, it&#x27;s a joke, switching TV channels takes a good solid second of redrawing the screen, etc. etc.<p>Tile tags. I loved the concept, I felt bad when Apple almost literally ran them over recently, but I kept replacing batteries literally all the time and the app kept telling me within a few short weeks or months to replace the battery yet again.
