34759518,"Ask HN: Web dev looking to learn new skills for job security, what should I do?",2023-02-12T03:49:59Z,ralmidani,1,false,false,,,,,,"With layoffs left and right, and bootcamps continuing to graduate more developers, I honestly feel threatened as I’ve spent pretty much my entire career doing Web dev stuff - Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;CoffeeScript&#x2F;Ember (for startup ideas I explored), then Java&#x2F;Spring (don’t ask), and currently Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix full-time. I fear there is or soon will be a glut of Web devs especially.<p>I’m looking for suggestions for learning something that might help me have better job security, even if I don’t need to move out of Web dev completely. Also, I’m not looking to change companies voluntarily in the near future.<p>- I’ve been considering looking into Data Engineering, ML, and&#x2F;or AI. My Math background is not solid (I got up to basic integration but never completed Calc 2, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, or advanced Probability&#x2F;Statistics). How much Math do I really need, and what’s an effective way to learn it (I’m 42)?<p>- I really like Elixir and its ecosystem, and have an interest in learning Nx&#x2F;Axon&#x2F;Bumblebee, but Python’s ecosystem is more established and seems to have much more mindshare. Does anyone have a day job doing Data Science-type things with Elixir?<p>- Has anyone been able to transition to new tech fields via Udacity&#x2F;Coursera&#x2F;EdX without huge side projects to show? I am willing to put time into learning and side projects, but doubt I have the ability to treat it as a second job.<p>- Outside of DS&#x2F;DE&#x2F;ML&#x2F;AI, I’m also interested in Programming Languages and Compilers. Is there an abundance of meaningful work in these areas where someone without a CS degree (just a Web dev bootcamp and some university courses up to Data Structures) could potentially get a foot in the door?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
