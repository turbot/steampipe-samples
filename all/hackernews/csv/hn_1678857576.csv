It was due for a service anyway, so I took it in. When I got the bill, there was a $99 item for labor to &quot;fix&quot; App Connect. The rep said the car was no longer under warranty. I refused to pay: in my mind this is a software bug, not ware and tare, and so warranty rules do not apply. Luckily, they waved a bill.<p>So here is the ask: If a car&#x27;s software is buggy, and the bug only manifests itself after the warranty has expired, should the owner have to pay for the repair?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
