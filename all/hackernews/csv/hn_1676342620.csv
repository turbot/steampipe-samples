It also appears that the common goal for many leaders in the space is to then deploy and spin up these “beings” dynamically for use in a broad range of conditions, with the vast majority of cases being repetitive labour. It therefore seems to me that this is homologous to birthing many standard biological humans and enslaving them with complicated extra steps. I’d be very eager to hear people’s thoughts on this.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
