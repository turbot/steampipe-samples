35210354,Show HN: GPT-4 Analyzed Customer Feedback to Replace NPS Scores,2023-03-18T16:21:08Z,kiddz,1,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;m excited to share a new platform called AskHumans (askhumans.io), which aims to transform the way organizations gather customer feedback by leveraging GPT. The goal is to provide a more insightful and personalized alternative to the widely used but often limited Net Promoter Score (NPS).<p>Having launched startups before, a consistent challenge has been gathering meaningful customer feedback. We believe that large language models (LLMs) can enable personalized feedback at scale, which can be turned into weighted sentiment scores that offer more informative insights than traditional NPS scores.<p>Moreover, we think that the future advantage of firms with AI is not solely about the algorithms but also about the unique data sets these algorithms can analyze. By incentivizing customers to give open-ended feedback, organizations can create unique data streams that will become increasingly more valuable to them over time.<p>AskHumans&#x27; innovative tech stack includes React Native, Rails, and GPT for sentiment analysis (replacing IBM Watson). The platform allows organizations to ask open-ended questions to their customers or stakeholders, and collect verbal feedback. This feedback is then analyzed by AI to better understand service quality, product satisfaction, and customer experience at scale.<p>One regional coffee brand&#x27;s district manager experienced the potential of AskHumans firsthand. Upon witnessing the sentiment analysis, he realized how much more comprehensive understanding of customer experiences he could gain compared to the limited information from his location&#x27;s NPS score of 7.8.<p>We believe that the application of AI in customer feedback, combined with unique data sets, will usher in a new era of insights, allowing organizations to make better-informed decisions and enhance their customer experiences.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on the potential of AI-driven customer feedback, the tech stack behind AskHumans, or your own experiences with NPS scores. If you have any questions or comments, please share them below.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Yesterday I tried to create an Instagram page for my food-related project to advertise it through social ads. I used my MacBook, my home IP within the EU and a Google workspace email address. The domain was recently acquired and has no negative history. The account name and domain are food-related and completely safe for work.<p>2. After entering the email confirmation code for sign up the account was immediately banned (Error message: “Something has gone wrong”). Ehhh weird. I thought it was a mistake and tried to login with the credentials I had just set.<p>3. The login worked and I was then asked to complete a reCAPTCHA and provide a mobile phone number. OK fine. I completed the reCAPTCHA, provided my number and entered the confirmation code. Then I was asked to upload a picture of my face and a piece of paper with the account name and another code written on it. (?!?!)<p>4. I also complied with this absurd inquiry and uploaded a picture of my face and a piece of paper with the account name and code written on it. 24 hours later I received an email that stated I would not be able to use this account because I didn’t upload an acceptable image. (The image was completely fine and included exactly the details Instagram had asked for!)<p>5. The end result: The account was permanently banned for doing… nothing. There is no way to appeal the decision. The account name that matches my domain is now taken by an account that doesn&#x27;t even exist.<p>All in all this was the most bizarre interaction I’ve ever had with an online platform. Your bot detection seems to be totally off and produce absurd false positives. Why would you instantly ban an account on sign-up and then make the ban permanent after all the human verification requests have been completed dutifully?<p>I used the same email address and IP to create an account on Reddit, Pinterest, Twitter and TikTok without any issues afterwards. Permanently banning faithful actors on sign-up who are looking to buy ads might hurt your bottom line.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
