As a student from Southeast Asia, I am fully adept in living in various conditions, especially abroad. I have a full-ride scholarship and can get extra support from my university as I am expecting to graduate with the Vice Chancellor&#x27;s award, and have been nominated by the Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences to represent the faculty to study in Canada previously.<p>However, where I live, employers often take interns for granted. Most of us gets conned into thinking we are having trained for what we learned, but instead have to use photocopier machines every day and, sometimes with no salaries provided (just &quot;gift&quot; allowance of less than 100 usd per three months.)<p>I hope someone can guide me on where I can send my application.

But then it really started to bother me because I had no control over my feed.<p>So, for the past 5 years, as a side project, I have been working on a good feed reader app with multiple iterations. The first version was a wrapper on top of Feedly API, the second one was an RSS reader from scratch, and the latest one is a full-featured one that supports many sources (RSS&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;Youtube&#x2F;Medium&#x2F;Newsletters in the same feed).<p>I have been using&#x2F;improving the latest version on a daily basis for the past year and I really thought it&#x27;s awesome.<p>So I polished it to share with friends (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mofeed.news) but it seems like no one is interested and they don&#x27;t care about how they get their news.<p>I&#x27;m okay with this since I wanted it for myself anyways. It&#x27;s just odd to me that my friends are not interested.<p>Now I&#x27;m very curious if Feed aggregators are dead or not.
