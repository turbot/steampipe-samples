It is a pain to review their code. You would point out 100 of syntax errors and pitfalls and they would make the same mistake again in next pull request.<p>What is worst is that they would push back against you. They are fine with duplicate code or less maintainable code or design which will not scale as long as it gets the task done.<p>I keep asking the seniors for direction however they are evaluated on the estimates they gave and the feedback they would get.
So they would optimise such that the task does not take more time.<p>What is worse is that they are evaluated on feedback. So they use sugar coated words ?<p>Initially I was fine with it but now I feel its dishonesty to the job. If someone is gaming the system then I also ask myself why I am trying so hard ?<p>Thanks for listening to my rant.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
