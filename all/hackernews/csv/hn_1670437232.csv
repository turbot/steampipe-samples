It’s a personal workflow assistant that was built for devs and their teams to automate non-coding tasks, giving updates and quick actions only on what’s relevant.<p>It works by examining your activity in Jira and GitHub (more systems being added soon) to understand your workflow, creates context out of all that information, and offers you actionable assistance from Slack.<p>Zigi is customiazible. We’re building it to match every R&amp;D persona so you can tailor the messages and assistance you get to meet your specific needs. Like if you’re TL, you can get daily updates on the progress of your team’s sprint or as a QA, you’ll be notified as soon as ticket is ready for testing.<p>We’re developers who are used to managing big R&amp;D teams and over the last few years, we have seen dev change drastically. There’s so much overhead on top of coding, more dependencies, multiple tools, that developers are overloaded. And now, the world has changed to make teams are remote and in different time zones, which just makes everything more complex.<p>Zigi takes a new approach to driving productivity, while keeping devs and their teams happy. It provides hands-on help with personalized automation, so we can manage our day-to-day tasks with minimal distractions and maximum focus.<p>Some things to know about Zigi: you don’t need to set it up or run any config; it’s customizable to your needs; it only needs user-level permissions and doesn&#x27;t read or scan your code; it’s ISO 27001&#x2F;27017 &amp; Soc 2 Type 2 certified and GDPR compliant.<p>It’s also free for devs.<p>Sign up to get started here.

Just wanted to share the story of bringing it to fruition here on hn.<p>I started out spending a couple days trying to get something cross-platform going in Flutter, but it soon became clear that wasn&#x27;t the best fit, seeing as I&#x27;d need native hooks for most of what the app needed to do, and it wasn&#x27;t yet clear it&#x27;d be possible at all. So I switched to making it an iOS app in Swift. The accelerometer data turned out to be not nearly accurate enough to do the job, so I switched to using the camera&#x2F;AR using ARKit... and it worked instantly. Like the very first time I hooked up a slider UI element to the distance function. It felt a bit like magic.

I&#x27;m struggling, however, to wrap my brain around charging money, and paywalling posts or parts of posts.<p>While I have experience using a Patreon for more voluntary donations, I feel like I&#x27;m kind of jumping into the deep end of the pool. Paywalling articles, or parts of articles, is now interrupting peoples&#x27; &quot;full experience&quot; in order to prompt them to pay to continue.<p>This means there&#x27;s a risk <i>no one</i> will subscribe, and I&#x27;ll have a somewhat worse product for that. However, I would like to earn income from the project, and I would like to avoid the awkwardness of enabling it later (in case the newsletter is successful); I think the latter would be more of an annoyance to people already invested than having subscriptions enabled from the start.<p>I was curious about HN&#x27;s perspective, mostly because I imagine there&#x27;s a lot of devs here that have gone from free projects&#x2F;products to ones that either are trial-based, subscription-based, or one-time purchases.<p>How did you get over that awkwardness towards &quot;being ballsy enough to ask to be paid&quot;?<p>--
Notes:<p>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that I&#x27;ve freelanced before, so getting paid for my writing is not something I&#x27;m new to.
