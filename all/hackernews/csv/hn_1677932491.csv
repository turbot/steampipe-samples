35020267,Ask HN: How to deal with the loss of magic as a student?,2023-03-04T12:10:18Z,tempor-schule,2,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;m a 23 y&#x2F;o Software Engineering student who is on the cusp of finishing his studies. The problem is I am finding myself in a situation where I am aprehending the fact I need to code. All the magic and passion I had entering my degree has all but disappeared. I tried restarting it by much of the common advice that is given here : do some personal project I am passioned about, take some break. I even moved out and did my last year of studies in Germany to try and change environnement but nothing solved this. I just continued giving the minimum effort in my classes as nothing that I studied filled me with some feeling, not the theoretical maths, not the shiny AI&#x2F;ML, networks or language paradigms.<p>I am worried about it as I have not even started my career and I already have symptoms of what other people here in HN talk about mid-career. Another problem is that to obtain my degree (french rules) I need to realise a 6 month internship and I do not feel ready or willing to do so, as I feel I would be a drag for the company and it would also add to this whole situation.<p>Has anyone been in this situation, and if so how did you deal with it?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
