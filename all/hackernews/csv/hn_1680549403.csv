But now I&#x27;m wondering if this guy is actually taking the &quot;long view&quot; and will end up being remembered as one of the great thinkers.<p>The AI&#x2F;ML revolution is just getting started, and it promises to upend much of human society. I&#x27;d say a backlash is inevitable, and will intensify as the tech gets more and more capable. Given that there WILL be a major backlash in the future (far more major than what we see today), I think Yudkowski may have positioned himself as the &quot;grandfather&quot; of a new, budding ideology defined by anti-technology and anti-AI views. Like Smith or Marx before him, Yudkowski makes provocative proclamations about a concept that seems like it will define our coming century. I wonder if what he&#x27;s said so far is already enough to make him the &quot;face&quot; of an anti-AI movement that in my opinion will likely grow to rival even the most powerful ideologies of history.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

There are maybe twenty people that make up the core volunteers. I fill several different roles within the organization including the default “IS&#x2F;IT” guy simply because of my background. Nobody else in the organization has a technology background so over the years, as we’ve needed things, people have looked to me to set those things up. I don’t have analysts to define user stories and requirements so along the way, I’ve had to just decide security myself. It definitely is something I always am thinking about and I try to get as many people involved (access-wise) in as many things as I can so the burden sits with me as little as possible.<p>One of our board members has decided everyone on the board should have complete, unrestricted access to everything. From the combination to the lock on the little cabinet that houses the modem and gateway router and the passwords for those devices, to full-administrator privileges on all of our software “systems” (Google Workspace, Mailchimp, Square, Azure, etc.)<p>Another board member is now rallying with that board member so it is going to be an entire discussion point at our next board meeting.<p>Part of me wants to just go ahead and do it. Everyone can start sending newsletters through Mailchimp (we have just one person who coordinates them all now) and we won’t have any standards on formatting, frequency, etc. Everyone can setup new groups and users in Google Workspace and create shared drives like they are folders. Why not?<p>I want to explain that less access means less exposure to systems being compromised. It means not having the person who does a function different from yours digging into your projects randomly and deciding to “help.” It means you won’t end up locked out later because somebody else in a few years decides tightened security is needed and starts arbitrarily making decisions about that.<p>Are there any other good reasons I should give these particular board members why this is a bad idea?
