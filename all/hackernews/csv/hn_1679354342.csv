Over the years, I feel the lack of openness has gotten worse to the point of reflexive hostility. So often when people launch their startups here, the comments immediately hone in on picking the ideas and products apart, not to offer productive advice and encouragement, but seemingly just for the sake of criticism. Very few attempt to entertain the vision the founder may be working towards and offer constructive advice on how to get there.<p>Seems like the hostility hit its most irrational peak with the sentiment here towards startups who banked with SVB. Many seemed to go so far as to almost hope we’d see a startup meltdown.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
