Slauth auto-generates IAM policies in order to save engineering time and make your policies more secure.<p>If you&#x27;re an engineer, you probably know how tedious and error-prone it can be to manually write IAM policies. We surveyed over 70 engineers and found out that a majority are using or have used wildcards (*) in order to quickly write IAM policies.<p>By using client-side monitoring or via a proxy, Slauth.io observes all of the API activity and generates a policy based on functionality and least privileges.<p>Once deployed in a remote environment, or run locally, you will need to run an end-to-end test using a wildcard policy. Slauth will observe the activity, apply its logic based on large amounts of behavioral patterns of the service you deploy, and create a high quality IAM policy.<p>The IAM policy will be presented through the Slauth Dashboard where it can be copy&#x2F;pasted or as a pull-request into your Git repository ready to be reviewed. Integrations with IaC services such as Terraform are also available.<p>Our objective is to automate manual error-prone IAM policy writing in order to increase engineering velocity, reduce friction and harden security.<p>Would love your feedback on the value proposition and if you would use the AWS SDK or Slauth proxy for onboarding.<p>Feel free to also sign up for Beta usage! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slauth.io",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
