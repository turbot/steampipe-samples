34725138,Show HN: Pythagora – auto generated integration tests for Node.js API servers,2023-02-09T15:11:53Z,zvonimirs,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN,<p>I just released my first npm package so wanted to share it here.<p>Pythagora is a Node.js module that creates automated integration tests for MERN&#x2F;MEAN apps by recording server activity.<p>To integrate Pythagora, you need to paste one line of code to your repository and run the Pythagora capture CLI command. Then, just play around with your app and from all API requests and database queries Pythagora will generate integration tests.<p>When running tests, it doesn’t matter what database is your Node.js connected to or what is the state of that database. Actually, that database is never touched or used —&gt; instead, Pythagora creates a special, ephemeral `pythagoraDb`
 database, which it uses to restore the data before each test is executed, that was present at the time when the test was recorded. Because of this, tests can be run on any machine or environment.<p>Also, *if the request updates the database, after the API returns the response, Pythagora checks the database to see if it was updated correctly*.<p>Finally, Pythagora tracks (using istanbul&#x2F;nyc) lines of code that were triggered during tests, so you know how much of your code is covered.<p>Our goal is to help teams that don’t have time to properly manage their test suite to cover their entire codebase with as little as 1 hour of their time. We tested Pythagora on open source clones of apps like Reddit, IG, etc. and we were able to get to 50% of code coverage within 10 minutes and to 90% within 1 hour of playing around these apps.<p>Feel free to try out the Pythagora npm package - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;pythagora<p>And the source code on Github - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pythagora-io&#x2F;pythagora<p>We’re excited to hear what you think.<p>How do you write integration tests for an API server? Would you consider using Pythagora instead&#x2F;along with your system?<p>If not, we would love to hear what are your concerns and why this wouldn’t work for you?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

In this world, scientifically-minded time and resource rich doctors work together with patients to continuously monitor biomarkers, nutrition, and life circumstances in order to nip problems in the bud and implement small and precise interventions. In my world, doctors do not engage with optimization or prevention or small maybe-problems that are not yet guaranteed to become real problems. Generally, in the absence of an acute issue, doctors have always been short and dismissive and fixated on not overtesting or overprescribing - and they have no interest in my advanced-amateur understanding of my own health and biology.<p>How does one go from the typical medical-scarcity world to the Huberman world? Is it possible to find these kinds of doctors? Is it a question of simply finding elite doctors and paying them out of pocket? If such doctors are either unavailable or unaffordable - are there any possibilities for &quot;remote health coaching&quot;, something akin to teletherapy?<p>Generally, I&#x27;m interested in holistic resources. If I have to, I will DIY, and I am willing to invest a lot of time in self-education, although I am not willing to go to medschool. But, other than the Huberman podcast and various in-the-weeds online discussion forums, I lack a comprehensive overview at my HN-typical level of understanding.

My now former colleague got access to my computer while he lived in my apartment. The damage was not so big, an order of 120$ in an online shop. It could have been worse.<p>&quot;The past has shown time and again that the damage is often done by those closest to you. Ancient Rome is an example of this.&quot;<p>The biggest problem was that I had not noticed it for a long time. 
For this reason, I have created a simple and cheap honeypot that you can spread out on your computer or print out. It takes the person to an attractive honeypot website with a login. After that you get notified per email that someone logged in.<p>The page exists for 1 year, but I have redesigned it.
What do you think about the page?<p>[Demo]<p>www.loginbait.com",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Our team is not big enough to manually handle translations in different languages.<p>I know there are dozens of Translation services available but it seems that they are used to translate a string - we want all text translated after all JavaScript is loaded.<p>The thing is that both Edge and Chrome has built in translator features (which I guess call their respective APIs in the background). We have tried out those and the result is usually great (at least when translating to our native language).<p>Is it possible to call those browser translation services manually through an JS API? Also - we already have some users using those built in translation functions - to what quota are these counted on? I mean if we would have millions of users translating our page through the browser translation service - we ourself have no agreement with the translation providers?<p>Any input on this?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
