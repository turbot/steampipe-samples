Bounie is a news website where anyone can contribute to the stories. Bounie is inspired by open source software and websites like Wikipedia and Urban Dictionary.<p>Some notable features:
- It all starts with creating a catchy headline. Users can then come together to contribute to that story.
- Articles are made up of dynamic feeds of user contributed information instead of traditional walls of text.
- Comments are a part of the article, not a separate section.
- I&#x27;m testing out an AI reporter that responds to each new user submitted headline with its opinion on it to get the conversation started.<p>Please let me know what you think of Bounie! What do you think of the concept of articles being crowdsourced? Do you like the AI reacting to each headline or do you think it is unnecessary?",story,https://bounie.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Think of the randomness like the magic number for minecraft maps: It can create repeatably the same world just from one number and the same version. Or the seed number in stable diffusion: Same prompt, same seed, same modell = always the same result.<p>But not for GPT3, ChatGPT and GPT4. I wonder why.<p>I&#x27;m quite mad that this random seed is not presented to be preserved or available as an input. It would speed up scientific exploration, produce differen&#x2F;better fidelity tests.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
