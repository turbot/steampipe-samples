Just curious as to what possibilities are in this scenario.<p>There is a deadlock in geopolitics. China is making dams on River Ganges and Bhramputra. These dams will be completed by 2028. This means less water downstream for India. For a nation of 1.5 billion with mostly agriculture based population, this would be a death knell. China also needs this water to support its industrial activities.<p>So, why would India not go to war with China?<p>An India-China War would definitely result in WW3.<p>Edit: If US concedes India, they stop being the world leader and instead China will take its place. This means US + Europe will side with India which means Russia will side with China. Hence, the world war.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
