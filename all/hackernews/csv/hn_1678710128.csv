Ideally it would be practical as well (Java&#x2F;Python dev). A quick browse of ebay tells me the Sparc workstations have entered collector status. Maybe something towards the end of Sun&#x27;s lifetime? Or buy a Java workstation case and put modern components in it? What does HN suggest?,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35134601,Show HN: Chitty – A native ChatpGPT client for macOS with custom assistants,2023-03-13T12:12:30Z,DerJacques,1,false,false,1,[35134607],,,,"Chitty is a ChatGPT client for MacOS, built with SwiftUI. Lots of ChatGPT clients are being published every day, but I wanted to focus on two things:<p>1. I wanted a &quot;real&quot; native ChatGPT client, not just a wrapped web view. Chitty closely resembles an iMessage like interface, which should feel familiar to most users instantly.<p>2. Chitty should allow you to chat with multiple AI personalities. These AI personalities can be real people (chat with Abraham Lincoln about his life), or made up.<p>The app comes pre-loaded with a handful of historic AI personalities that you can interact with: Jane Austen, Alan Turing, and Sojourner Truth. I focused on historic figures instead of more recent personalities, to remedy issues related to IP and plain bad taste. That being said, I also had fun adding some of my own programming heroes, and solving code problems with them. ChatGPT is great at impersonating people, as long as you tell it to stay in character.<p>I hope you find it helpful. Chitty is free for now, and likely will stay free, but who knows.",story,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chitty-ai-conversations/id6446221412?mt=12,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
