The bits are transmitted over switches and routers instead of a cartridge with a magnetic tape, improving the latency for the end-user and YT also has the recommendation system which is usually a hit-or-miss. YT has definitely the largest educational content to offer, though it can be difficult to find or even search for it. And it&#x27;s lacks interactivity, has the comment system of 1990s. Khan Academy overcomes some of YT&#x27;s deficits, but adds too much friction to the user interface and user experience and is a one-man show. Is there any innovation happening in this field, and what is your opinion on the future of this education technology?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

While the numbers are terrific, we were expecting somewhere around 20,000-25,000 users. But, I’m confident we’ll get there in the coming months. After analysing our competitors thoroughly we believe we’re closing the loose ends with stronger customer support and seamless payment cash-ins and outs.”<p>The KickRummy app features a variety of game variants of the classic Indian rummy game like points rummy, deals rummy and pool rummy as well as different stakes to cater to players of all levels.

34653793,Show HN: Discover developers sharing their side projects,2023-02-04T11:59:53Z,danoely,1,false,false,,,,,,"Myself and three friends, for the last year have been building our own side project, the aim of this side project was to show off the creative side of developers. One of my bug bears with Reddit is how quickly things get buried. The bug bear has turned into the basis for what I been building on the side called The Full Stack. A platform to show off developer projects basically. Another bug bear of mine over the years has been trying to find open source or just cool side projects to work on with others, and even find teams to join. So that&#x27;s another thing we&#x27;ve built, an easy way to find people and projects to work with.<p>Some freaking awesome projects posted on the platform!!<p>The platform front end is all built in ReactJS (Nextjs) and Tailwind, hosted on Vercel.  On the backend we&#x27;re rocking both NodeJS and Java.<p>We&#x27;re planning on open sourcing the platform once the code and UI flow gets to a decent standard (been working on getting this together), a long way to go. So if anyone here has any advice on bringing a code base to an OSS standard be great to DM and chat.<p>So for me personally I&#x27;d love to hear people&#x27;s feedback and comments!",story,https://thefullstack.network,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
