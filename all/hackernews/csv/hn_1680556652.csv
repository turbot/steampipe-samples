35431145,Show HN: Daba – Turn your JSON into a database,2023-04-03T20:54:30Z,zikero,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hi all, I built this tool when I needed a simple LocalStorage-esque database for a client project, and figured others might want something similar.<p>Basically turns your JSON into a query-able, hosted database in seconds. You can read&#x2F;update&#x2F;delete JSON files by path, just like you would in Javascript. So, something like get(”users[7].address”)<p>And while we’re at it, I also built a simple file storage service where you upload a file and it gives you the URL back.<p>A lot of my (and other devs friends&#x27;) side projects will never require more data than a JSON file can handle. Yet we always have to go through the hoops of setting up and using databases meant to handle huge amounts of data.<p>There are many other services that could benefit from the same minimalist philosophy. The idea is to have a bunch of building blocks of different services, and let the developer scale up&#x2F;down the complexity as they see fit. I&#x27;m working on more services for daba (In no particular order: SQLite db?, auth, emails, …)<p>You can use this for any applications where the data can fit in a JSON file. (e.g. Website CMS, blog, portfolio, small mobile apps, internal tools, …). You’ll be surprised at how much data a 20mb JSON file can hold: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;json-iterator&#x2F;test-data&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;large-file.json"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;json-iterator&#x2F;test-data&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;large...</a><p>Let me know what you think",story,https://www.daba.so,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
