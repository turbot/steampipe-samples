34927427,Ask HN: How do I figure out my next move?,2023-02-24T17:52:32Z,lnoir,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN!<p>I&#x27;m a 43 year old, black, late-diagnosed Autistic male in Software Engineering. I started professionally in 2010. I&#x27;m an autodidact with no formal education in the field and no degrees to my name. I learned by reading and building in Python, then PHP for the first few years of my career. The remaining years have been full-stack JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript, with sprinkles of Java and recent dabbling in C# (Unity) and Lua (Roblox).<p>I&#x27;ve worked in both obscure and well-known organisations such as Time Inc, Penguin Random House and the UK Home Office. The longest I&#x27;ve been at a company is 4 years, but burnout has on occasion limited my time at a company to ~6 months.<p>My most recent role was at a small e-commerce start-up and it ended about a month ago. I was relieved because, although my manager and team mate was a great guy, I didn&#x27;t get much satisfaction from the work or the company. I generally need at least one of these things to feel satisfied:
 - a satisfying &quot;why&quot; for what I&#x27;m doing
 - opportunity for creativity and discovery<p>Beyond work, I&#x27;ve had numerous side projects:
 - email platform
 - location based messaging platform
 - companion mobile app for Binance
 - &quot;indestructible&quot; CMS (Git-integrated SSG for simple blogging)
 - crypto arbitrage mobile app<p>I&#x27;m obsessive. If I imagine it I have to build it. Unfortunately, marketing and sales don&#x27;t trigger me, or I&#x27;d probably have built a business by now... I love investigation, formulating a solution, and then hacking away to a working product. I saw this post[0] a few weeks back and it really resonated.<p>Most jobs don&#x27;t trigger my obsession. They typically feel like a bunch of chores. I find myself dragging my feet and frequently consider if I&#x27;m just lazy. I can&#x27;t buy into that idea, though, because I put in tremendous effort when I&#x27;m truly interested and inspired! Hours of the day and days of the week become irrelevant; code flows until the gremlins in my mind are satisfied.<p>Too often it&#x27;s the case that my job interest is dim, while my side-project interest burns bright. I end up coding 16 hours per day until I burn out. That, or I get so drained by the work I&#x27;m doing in the day job that it sends me into depression.<p>--- What do I want from you?<p>Whatever you&#x27;ve got. Advice. Suggestions. Recommendations. Inpsiration, maybe. Perhaps even just a conversation with someone who can relate. I&#x27;ve seen how many insightful individuals there are in this community - I&#x27;d like to tap into that.<p>When I got into Software Engineering I was sure I was going to code my way to independence (working for myself). All these years later I still don&#x27;t think I have all the components to create a sustainable business (be it skills, experience or the right people), so I&#x27;ll no doubt be looking for another job. But I don&#x27;t want just _any_ job. I can&#x27;t just build UIs all day, or write another REST (or GraphQL) API.<p>I&#x27;ve strongly considered if I should do something else entirely and save code for pleasure and side-projects, but I&#x27;ve got no idea what that &quot;something else&quot; might be. I have savings that can sustain me for a few months (I save pretty aggressively) so I can take my time a bit to explore, but not for too long. Plus, I&#x27;d rather not burn through all my savings.<p>I want the sense of discovery - learning something new and applying it. I also want the variety so things don&#x27;t get too repetitive. And, of course, the creativity - having an open ended question before me and being left to come up with an answer.<p>I suppose I could just ask ChatGPT[1], or even AskHN[2] but, there&#x27;s no subtitute for the real thing (for now, at least).<p>If you read to the end, thank you for giving your time to it. I wanted to provide enough context without oversharing&#x2F;overexplaining (which I&#x27;m prone to).<p>[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34366610
