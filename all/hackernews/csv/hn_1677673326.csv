34981531,"Show HN: PixelForge – Verticalize YouTube Videos with AI for TikTok, Reels",2023-03-01T12:19:10Z,RiadEtm,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi everyone!<p>PixelForge aims at easily convert horizontal videos into vertical videos without having to go through the tedious process of video editing again.<p>Among the different possibilities, I really wanted PixelForge to be efficient in the following areas:<p>- Developing your audience on YouTube<p>- Growing your audience on other platforms<p>- Reduce the financial impact of content repost in other&#x2F;same platforms<p>- Getting more value out of your horizontal videos.<p>So what&#x27;s the problem? Why this project ?<p>As a former content creator on YouTube (+50k subs &amp; ~5M views), I&#x27;ve seen the platform evolve and I&#x27;ve witnessed several problems over the years.<p>One of the best ways to succeed on YouTube today is to Shorts, which they are known to have have a wider reach. However, this can be a big challenge when your content is mainly horizontal.<p>In addition, many creators have their content stolen and republished on platforms like TikTok and Reels for monetization purposes, resulting in a significant loss of revenue. Unfortunately, extracting a vertical video from a horizontal video is not an easy task and requires a lot of extra work in video editing.<p>-&gt; The solution?<p>PixelForge tackles this problem head on. The tool allows content creators to work on their horizontal video as they usually do. But once the video is published, they can quickly generate tiktoks&#x2F;shorts&#x2F;reels using the AI-powered tool that slices the horizontal video into relevant segments. The creator only has to choose the different segments to compose his final vertical video that he can publish on different platforms.<p>-&gt; What&#x27;s next?<p>PixelForge is a new tool, but I&#x27;d like to continue developing it with your help. 
Here are some of the features I&#x27;m currently working on:<p>- Adapting the tool to handle Twitch to extract vertical videos from streams<p>- A system to select the cropping area of interest in the video instead of just centering<p>- Automatically generating text on the video in a &quot;tiktok&quot; way.<p>- ... and I&#x27;m open to suggestions ! :)<p>If you are interested in the development of this project, I will share its progress from time to time on twitter: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RiadEtm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RiadEtm</a><p>Product Hunt: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;pixelforge"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;pixelforge</a>",story,https://pixelforge.art,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

In my experience of reading about Software developers they prefer not to pay for the tools they use. Generalisation.<p>If I had to pay for my open source stack, it would be expensive because of the value provided.<p>So my idea is why isn&#x27;t there a company that provides payment services that offers expensive software in return for a proportion of revenue?<p>You could have a community website that was pay-as-you-go that offered payments integration for automatic collection of revenue.<p>The idea being, build your side project with us and you&#x27;ll pay as you go<p>The company would be designed around a scalable architecture that can handle rapid growth.
