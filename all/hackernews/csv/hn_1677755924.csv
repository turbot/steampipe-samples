What should I do?,2023-03-02T11:02:43Z,throwaway091472,4,false,false,2,"[34994461,34994458]",,,,"The company I work for, a medium sized online retailer in Europe, revoked 3 job offers a week before the new employees were supposed to start. All of them had already handed in their notices so were essentially left jobless.<p>One of them was accepted back to their previous company, but the other 2 are still looking for new roles.<p>I am very disappointed and upset about my company&#x27;s behaviour. I know it&#x27;s not uncommon in the industry and it&#x27;s due to a recruitment freeze, but I still find it reprehensible. I feel things could&#x27;ve been handled differently. It also sends a very bad message to the rest of the company.<p>My colleagues are disappointed too and talk about how bad, disgusting it was, but so far no one has taken any action. Should we voice our concerns collectively?<p>I am bitter and not sure I can get over it even though my job is safe. I know I can find something quickly, should I leave (terminate my relationship with them) and make it clear it&#x27;s because of the aforementioned reasons?<p>I feel like what they did, albeit legal (?), is immoral and unjust and there has to be some sort of tangible response.<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and advice please.
