I&#x27;m pretty sure the Twitter subculture are also depressed too, but it feels like they&#x27;ve managed to radicalise themselves into it via Likes<p>It also started back on the pre-social media internet - Ana Mardoll was a Shakesville person, Tumblr learned its academic privilege checking language (that it used for interpersonal bullying) from blogosphere posts being shared as &quot;Feminism 101&quot; material etc...<p>But the feeling on it lately is different. It&#x27;s gone past slapfights on Tumblr because there&#x27;s a feeling that Twitter is the site that changes the world. It&#x27;s a site where the people who write history hang out, while Tumblr is where the people who write fanfiction hang out.<p>It was, and still is, a valuable service to be able to criticise e.g. an event, or a proposed solution, by pointing out it isn&#x27;t as accessible as they think. And doing so feels counterintuitive, therefore smart and rewarding. Apply only that principle to activism and you get this<p>You get rewarded for being counterintuitive and pointing out hypothetical excluded people. Let&#x27;s base the entire thing on the feelings of hypothetical excluded people. Fuck you, old lady who &quot;loves&quot; &quot;talking&quot; to her &quot;husband&quot;, a lot of us can&#x27;t talk because we&#x27;re mute &amp; in pain!<p>It&#x27;s also a politic that can only come out of comfort, because it&#x27;s about the kind of politics that people can cultivate as a luxury. The person who called Chili Neighbor &quot;the most deeply racist person&quot; (not even because of the chili - in general) is a landlord<p>But not just a landlord, oh no, a landlord trying to get their renters to join their polycule. An actual imbalance of power - trying to get sex from people who depend on you for housing is a WAY more coercive situation than trying to give someone food they might not want<p>I think the reason these weirdos targeted Chinchillazilla is because she chooses happiness. She doesn&#x27;t spend all her time fighting people, she spends it raising a therapy pig and trying to spread joy to people around her. Her haters only know how to cut things down<p>This feels like the common thread for shitty online activism cults to me - they aren&#x27;t interested in building a world, just in punishment. If they are supportive to each other it&#x27;s usually just insincere lovebombing to encourage each other to post harder<p>And it all comes back to the Poster&#x27;s Paradox, which is that people who are happy and engaged with the world don&#x27;t post as much as people with not enough of an outlet. The fake disability activism chokes out the real kind because these people can outpost anyone with e.g. a life<p>It&#x27;s always people who are older than they should be. The person who wrote a ~2000 tweet thread about how Chili Neighbour is bad because her neighbours might not own bowls? 37 years old.<p>Ana Mardoll typifies the childishness - a children&#x27;s book purist with an &quot;innocent youth&quot; aesthetic in early middle age. It&#x27;s obviously fine to enjoy kid&#x27;s stuff as an adult, but he refuses to mature his perspective on it, ironically cutting himself off from childish glee<p>Fake disability activism is about infinite vulnerability, insurmountable problems impossible to even fight, and reactionary suspicion of kindness or happiness.
