But really held back from socializing much, because I wanted to do well at my very menial job.<p>A couple times colleagues tried to include me on projects, but I politely just focused on my work. Now many of them are leading very successful startups that I could&#x27;ve likely been an early employee at.<p>I ended up working at 2 failed startups (I got from cold applying), and have failed about 20 times building a side hustle of my own.<p>I feel like I needed to go through some struggle, but I can&#x27;t help but regret my choices.
