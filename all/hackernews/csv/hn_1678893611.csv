35169447,Show HN: Quality News – Towards a fairer ranking algorithm for Hacker News,2023-03-15T15:06:34Z,manx,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hello HN!<p>TLDR;<p>- Quality News is a Hacker News client that provides additional data and insights on submissions, notably, the upvoteRate metric.<p>- We propose that this metric could be used to improve the Hacker News ranking score.<p>- In-depth explanation: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme</a><p>The Hacker News ranking score is directly proportional to upvotes, which is a problem because it creates a feedback loop: higher rank leads to more upvotes leads to higher rank, and so on...<p><pre><code>                →
             ↗     ↘
    Higher Rank   More Upvotes
             ↖     ↙
                ←
</code></pre>
As a consequence, success on HN depends almost entirely on getting enough upvotes in the first hour or so to make the front page and get caught in this feedback loop. And getting these early upvotes is largely a matter of timing, luck, and moderator decisions. And so the best stories don&#x27;t always make the front page, and the stories on the front page are not always the best.<p>Our proposed solution is to use upvoteRate instead of upvotes in the ranking formula. upvoteRate is an estimate of how much more or less likely users are to upvote a story compared to the average story, taking account how much attention the story as received, based on a history of the ranks and times at which it has been shown. You can read about how we calculate this metric in more detail here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme</a><p>About 1.5 years ago, we published an article with this basic idea of counteracting the rank-upvotes feedback loop by using attention as negative feedback. We received very valuable input from the HN community (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659</a>). Quality News has been created based largely on this feedback.<p>Currently, Quality News shows the upvoteRate metric for live Hacker News data, as well as charts of the rank and upvote history of each story. We have not yet implemented an alternative ranking algorithm, because we don&#x27;t have access to data on flags and moderator actions, which are a major component of the HN ranking score.<p>We&#x27;d love to see the Hacker News team experiment with the new formula, perhaps on an alternative front page. This will allow the community to evaluate whether the new ranking formula is an improvement over the current one.<p>We look forward discussing our approach with you!<p>Links:<p>Site: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.social-protocols.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.social-protocols.org&#x2F;</a><p>Readme: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;social-protocols&#x2F;news#readme</a><p>Previous Blog Post: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felx.me&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;improving-the-hacker-news-ranking-algorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felx.me&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;improving-the-hacker-news-ranking...</a><p>Previous Discussion: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28391659</a>",story,https://news.social-protocols.org/top,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35169256,Launch HN: BuildFlow (YC W23) – The FastAPI of data pipelines,2023-03-15T14:55:01Z,calebtv,5,false,false,5,"[35169471,35169391]",,,,"Hey HN! We’re Caleb and Josh, the founders of BuildFlow (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buildflow.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buildflow.dev</a>). We provide an open source framework for building your entire data pipeline quickly using Python. You can think of us as an easy alternative to Apache Beam or Google Cloud Dataflow.<p>The problem we&#x27;re trying to solve is simple: building data pipelines can be a real pain. You often need to deal with complex frameworks, manage external cloud resources, and wire everything together into a single deployment (you’re probably drowning in Yaml by this point in the dev cycle). This can be a burden on both data scientists and engineering teams.<p>Data pipelines is a broad term, but we generally mean any kind of processing that happens outside of the user facing path. This can be things like: processing file uploads, syncing data to a data warehouse, or ingesting data from IoT devices.<p>BuildFlow, our open-source framework, lets you build a data pipeline by simply attaching a decorator to a Python function. All you need to do is describe where your input is coming from and where your output should be written, and BuildFlow handles the rest. No configuration outside of the code is required. See our docs for some examples: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buildflow.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buildflow.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro</a>.<p>When you attach the decorator to your function, the BuildFlow runtime creates your referenced cloud resources, spins up replicas of your processor, and wires up everything needed to efficiently scale out the reads from your source and then writes to your sink. This lets you focus on writing logic as opposed to interacting with your external dependencies.<p>BuildFlow aims to hide as much complexity as possible in the sources &#x2F; sinks so that your processing logic can remain simple. The framework provides generic I&#x2F;O connectors for popular cloud services and storage systems, in addition to &quot;use case driven” I&#x2F;O connectors that chain together multiple I&#x2F;O steps required by common use cases. An example “use case driven” source that chains together GCS pubsub notifications &amp; fetching GCS blobs can be seen here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buildflow.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;io-connectors&#x2F;gcs_notifications"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buildflow.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;io-connectors&#x2F;gcs_notificatio...</a><p>BuildFlow was inspired by our time at Verily (Google Life Sciences) where we designed an internal platform to help data scientists build and deploy ML infra &#x2F; data pipelines using Apache Beam. Using a complex framework was a burden on our data science team because they had to learn a whole new paradigm to write their Python code in, and our engineering team was left with the operational load of helping folks learn Apache Beam while also managing &#x2F; deploying production pipelines. From this pain, BuildFlow was born.<p>Our design is based around two observations we made from that experience:<p>(1) The hardest thing to get right is I&#x2F;O. Efficiently fanning out I&#x2F;O to workers, concurrently reading &#x2F; processing input data, catching schema mismatches before runtime, and configuring cloud resources is where most of the pain is. BuildFlow attempts to abstract away all of these bits.<p>(2) Most use cases are large scale but not (overly) complex. Existing frameworks give you scalability and a complicated programming model that supports every use case under the sun. BuildFlow provides the same scalability but focuses on common use cases so that the API can remain lightweight &amp; easy to use.<p>BuildFlow is open source, but we offer a managed cloud offering that allows you to easily deploy your pipelines to the cloud. We provide a CLI that deploys your pipeline to a managed kubernetes cluster, and you can optionally opt in to letting us manage your resources &#x2F; terraform as well. Ultimately this will feed into our VS Code Extension which will allow users to visually build their data pipelines directly from VS Code (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launchflow.com"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launchflow.com</a> for a preview). The extension will be free to use and will come packaged with a bunch of nice-to-haves (code generation, fuzzing, tracing, and arcade games (yep!) just to name a few in the works).<p>Our managed offering is still in private beta but we’re hoping to release our CLI in the next couple weeks. Pricing for this service is still being ironed out but we expect it to be based on usage.<p>We’d love for you to try BuildFlow and would love any feedback. You can get started right away by installing the python package: pip install buildflow. Check out our docs (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildflow.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildflow.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro</a>) and GitHub (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;launchflow&#x2F;buildflow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;launchflow&#x2F;buildflow</a>) to see examples on how to use the API.<p>This project is very new, so we’d love to gather some specific feedback from you, the community. How do you feel about a framework managing your cloud resources? We’re considering adding a module that would let BuildFlow create &#x2F; manage your terraform for you (terraform state would be dumped to disk). What are some common I&#x2F;O operations you find yourself rewriting? What are some operational tasks that require you to leave your code editor? We’d like to bring as many tasks into BuildFlow and our VSCode extension so you can avoid context switches.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m Guy, co-founder &amp; CTO at Ply. Excited to share our internal feature builder.<p>I&#x27;ve built a lot of internal products over the years, they can be really powerful when done right.<p>After experimenting in our previous company with different approaches for this, we came up with a new approach that worked really well - internal products inside existing products.<p>We&#x27;ve built a nocode platform that lets you build internal features into the apps you already use. (Think Gmail, HubSpot, Zendesk, etc).
You can add buttons that trigger interfaces inside those apps (Chrome extension based).<p>The features you build can use contextual data - data from the current item like an email in Gmail or a ticket in Zendesk.<p>You can also build instances of ChatGPT that are fed with contextual data about the item you&#x27;re on, so it can do more than just answer an email but also use data about the customer, your schedule or anything else.<p>The product is geared towards &quot;citizen developers&quot; but you can add code (only javascript for now) and make API requests.<p>A quick 4min overview from our website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;71e689c160cf4babbb3f2cb018c35b60"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;71e689c160cf4babbb3f2cb018c35b60</a><p>Happy to get some feedback!",story,https://ply.io,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

While I have come a long way from undergrad, I still have so much to learn in the world of software engineering. I prefer learning via a more hands on approach, but I’m not against reading either.<p>I’m just curious what resources (tutorials, books, blogs, etc.) you use to keep your software engineering skills sharp.<p>Edit: I personally work 99% on backend stuff. Currently, I use Typescript and our infrastructure is handled via code thanks to Amazon’s Typescript CDK library. For example, I know very little about the inner workings of AWS infrastructure and I don’t fully understand all the syntax when I review code related to our infrastructure. I have read quite a bit of the AWS documentation, but it’s just not clicking for me. Resources for learning more about AWS’ offerings is one of many topics I’d love to learn more about, but even general software engineering knowledge that applies to all languages&#x2F;technologies would be appreciated as well.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
