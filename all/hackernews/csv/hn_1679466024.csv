35257241,Ask HN: How did ChatGPT do? Tech stack advice for civic engagement app,2023-03-22T05:39:25Z,gkinsella,2,false,false,1,[35257251],,,,"I have no CS experience and I&#x27;m trying to build the next &#x27;killer app&#x27; for civic engagement. I asked ChatGPT for advice on the tech stack -- should I trust it?<p>My prompt:
I am an individual with no experience building software. I want to build an app for web browser and mobile. It is going to be the next &#x27;killer app&#x27; for civic engagement that has game-like features for citizens to see what&#x27;s happening in local, state and federal governments. It will allow them to easily identify their elected officials, trending topics and what their officials are saying or doing in those areas, create summaries of upcoming meetings or pieces of legislation, weigh in on how their representative should vote, share on social media, invite and follow friends, and an AI-generated search function to ask general questions like &quot;How has government spending changed over the last 10 years&quot;? I want the user experience to have an engaging, video game-like experience. Can you provide recommendations on the tech stack I should use to build this?<p>ChatGTP&#x27;s answer:
Building an app with game-like features for civic engagement would require a complex and feature-rich tech stack. Here are some recommendations on the tech stack that you can consider to build your app for both web browser and mobile:<p>Front-end development: You can use JavaScript and its popular frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue to build a responsive and interactive user interface for your app.<p>Back-end development: You can use Node.js and its popular frameworks such as Express or Koa to build the back-end of your app. For data storage, you can use NoSQL databases such as MongoDB or Firebase.<p>AI-generated search function: For the AI-generated search function, you can use machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to build a natural language processing (NLP) model. You can also consider using pre-built NLP APIs such as Google Cloud Natural Language API or Amazon Comprehend.<p>Social media integration: To enable social media sharing and authentication, you can use OAuth 2.0 protocol and its popular providers such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter.<p>Real-time features: For real-time features such as notifications and chat, you can use WebSockets or technologies like Firebase Realtime Database.<p>Deployment: You can deploy your app on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.<p>Testing and Debugging: You can use popular testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, or Chai for testing your app&#x27;s functionality and debugging tools like Chrome DevTools or VS Code Debugger.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I thought this was brilliant. Kind of a poetic AI version of Christian Marclay’s 24-hour cinematic masterpiece “The Clock” which sequentially stitched together a whole day of clocks and watches from the history of film.<p>I experimented with my own version of this but the results were always a bit naff and motivational.<p>Using AI for summarising and presenting real world data as a kind of ambient display is an idea that stuck with me, though, and this is the result.<p>Is it actually useful? Could it be a viable replacement for news doom scrolling? I’m not sure yet. Probably not. It was fun to make, though.
