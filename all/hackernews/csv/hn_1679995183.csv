35337676,Taking Magnesium tablet everyday changes my life,2023-03-28T08:56:57Z,ebfe1,2,false,false,2,[35337690],,,,"Just like the title said - I have always been active &amp; semi-fit but in recent years, I suddenly got struck with terrible muscle soreness. I would often get cramps when waking up, play sport or bad soreness after a light jog, lifting weight or doing any kind of exercise. The soreness won&#x27;t go away for days, sometimes a week or two which made it really hard to do any kind of exercise and I feel sluggish all the time and this went on for ages without me knowing why and doctor just discard it as &quot;you just need to get used to exercise and it will get better&quot;. A year ago, I was just looking for why I get these leg cramps every 2 days, someone suggested taking Magnesium and Vitamin B  - This was the turning point.<p>Now, 12 months later and i&#x27;m enjoying my life again! I am now able to run up the hills with my kids, wake up without leg cramps at all and the soreness from lifting weight heals within half of a day or a day. I just want to share this if someone is struggling with similar problem as I recently shared it with my dad and a couple of relatives and almost everyone were having great results so it seems like a not very well-known thing. :)",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
