I want to know what you think about it and what impact it will have on developers who worked in the US. 
Actually, as a China developer, it&#x27;s pretty familiar to us, and Huawei had something similar to this a long time ago, and Alibaba also has 996 which is almost the same thing as it. 
In China a lot of companies have the same things and even worse, why do these companies do things like that? because Huawei and Alibaba these kinds of big companies do it so they learn from it, and unfortunately these big company actually have also been very successful in their industries, 
So I wonder if the US will become the next China if Twitter gets more efficient and successful after this &#x27;hardcore&#x27; thing.<p>And the day before another day I post an ask on HN, and talk about 996 in China too, someone replays me that the reason people got 996 jobs in China is that they are low-level developers, and after twitter announce the &#x27;hardcore&#x27;, I don&#x27;t know will this change his mind",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
