I plan to buy a KVM switch to make it easier to switch between the 2 and to allow me to share my mouse and keyboard but would like to also use an ultrawide monitor for both since it seems most affordable KVMs are 2 ports.<p>Any suggestions? Also open to normal monitors that can properly daisy chain for both Windows and Mac using a DisplayPort KVM but my understanding is DisplayPort daisy chaining doesn’t work on Mac.,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I thought she was the love of my life and I would marry that woman. I&#x27;m also in the last year of my PhD in a sub-field I have never envisioned myself in and somehow slipped into due to Covid and my own passiveness and weak sense of self. The PhD is also not going super well and I&#x27;m stressed about not having enough research to finish in time. I also grew up in a dysfunctional family environment (toxic parent relationship, some narcissistic&#x2F;borderline traits in them) and have been struggling with the consequences of that on my development and mental health.<p>As you can see, I feel like I&#x27;ve hit rock bottom. On the outside I look all successful, in shape and doing a PhD in a prestigious research group. But most of the time in my life I&#x27;ve felt empty, doubting myself and struggling with a weak sense of self and unhealthy thought&#x2F;behavioural patterns that are hard to shed off.<p>I&#x27;ve read tons of psychology&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;self-help over the past 10 years and it helped to some extent. I&#x27;ve also started therapy 2 months ago, but it&#x27;s going slow and it hasn&#x27;t been very useful yet. The advice so far has boiled down to &quot;do things you like&quot;.<p>I would be grateful for any of your advice or shared life stories. At the moment I feel like standing in front of a massive pile of broken glass.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
