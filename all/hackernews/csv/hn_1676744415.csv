Today I am presenting a GPT-3 powered recruiting email generator.<p>Over the past few years, as many of you, I have been receiving an overwhelming number of recruiting emails both directly and via LinkedIn. Last week I was using some of my vacation and browsing through those messages, and I&#x27;ve noticed poorly executed obvious attempts of personalisation some of those have, or being simply poorly worded cold emails.<p>I thought to myself immediately about potential performance of GPT-3 in that field, and how such email generation could be easily automated, beating most of those human written generic messages.<p>I have also figured out, once I build such a tech demo, I could then respond to each of those unsummoned recruiting emails with a link to my tool, flipping the coin and turning recruiters into my leads.<p>Please let me know what you think about it. All feedback is welcome!",story,https://ai-recruiting-email.vercel.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
