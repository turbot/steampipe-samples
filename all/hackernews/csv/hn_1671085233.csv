I&#x27;m 51-years-old now, and have been typing non-stop since I got a computer in my 20s.<p>I used to type very naturally and easily, but in the last few years, I&#x27;ve noticed that I make a lot more mistakes. I spend a lot of time hitting backspace. It&#x27;s not painful, I&#x27;ve just somehow gotten worse at it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter which keyboard I work on. I have a mild ergonomic keyboard for my desk machine (a slight curve), but I&#x27;m just as bad on this as I am on my laptop (perfectly straight).<p>Typing long stretches of text now is burdensome. I used to love to type (I&#x27;ve written four books, including an O&#x27;Reilly title), but now I tend to avoid it. I&#x27;ve started dictating, in fact.<p>I have no diagnosed arthritic or repetitive stress injury (and again, it&#x27;s not painful).<p>Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice, coping mechanisms, or solutions?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Infact it is quite the opposite. Last year my father passed away after suffering a broken back above his diaphragm, because it was above the diaphragm he was unable to cough and clear his lungs. Sadly the only solution to this problem was a breathing tube and the subsequent binding of his arms to prevent the removal of the tube. As a result he was not able to communicate with us or the nurses. I believe his inability to communicate was the cause of him falling into a psychosis that eventually caused his passing.<p>I would like this button to use as part of a system I am building that will make use of Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT) made by Intel and used by Stephen Hawkins.<p>I am aware that the environment supports cameras and there are other more useful buttons but my knowledge and finances are limited and I just want to make a very simple tool that will help the next poor soul that finds themselves in a similar situation to my Dad&#x27;s.<p>Thanks.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
