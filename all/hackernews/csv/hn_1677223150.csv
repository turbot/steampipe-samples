I find it even more puzzling that most of the time they do, but sometimes they don&#x27;t.Kinda like I do here in this paragraph. It seems like a comparatively very simple issue to fix.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

So have two laptops with Windows 10. This morning was greeted by the full screen volunteering these machines for a Microsoft upgrade to Win 11. Providing only two options: Do it now or Schedule for later. Incredibly dark pattern and had to use task manager to dismiss it. The only other option seems to be accept the upgrade then say no to the license conditions. A button then appears that will &quot;allow&quot; you to proceed to your previously purchased Windows 10...The window takes the whole screen, has no minimize buttons visible, and until I decided the way to say yes, and then refuse the license agreement, or play with the task manager, almost caused it to launch the install. I would be late for an online meeting. This must be unacceptable behavior in some kind of jurisdiction?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
