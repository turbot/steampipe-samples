35023976,Ask HN: What software stack to select for my project (a modern retro computer)?,2023-03-04T20:03:22Z,codeguppy,4,false,false,,,,,,"Hello all,<p>I need your advice in selecting the software stack for an educational, boot-to-code computer. The computer will be an AIO with a keyboard, screen and a Linux board with just-enough CPU to run the coding environment.<p>The intent is that eventually in the future to turn the computer in a commercial product that will come bundled with a coding book that will teach coding to young audiences and enthusiasts. E.g. a modern-retro computer. 
Below are a few mockups and even a possible ad:<p>Pic1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;FqZl4tNWAAEVICB?format=jpg<p>Pic2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;Fo-QP-MX0AEOjUJ?format=jpg<p>Pic3: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;Fo-QP-PXEAIGSn4?format=jpg<p>The computer will offer a simple coding editor, a language (TBD) with a nice API for drawing shapes, put sprites, etc. on a graphical canvas.<p>Now, back to software stack that will power the coding environment (editor, menus, etc.) and a language interpreter (e.g. JavaScript).<p>Main requirement from software stack is to run on a low-powered Linux SBC and boot in under 5 seconds to coding environment.<p>I’m considering the following options:<p>1. Dart + Flutter + Skia (no X)<p>2. C# + Avalonia + Skia (no X)<p>3. Kotlin + Compose for Desktop + Skia (no X)<p>4. Pascal + Ultibo (no Linux)<p>5. C + LVGL (no X)<p>6. Vala + GTK (Linux w&#x2F; X)<p>7. HTML5 (Linux w&#x2F;X and Chromium engine).<p>What do you recommend?<p>P.S. Looking forward to your recommendations regarding features of the coding platform. My intent is that experience to be similar to fantasy consoles (but high-res) or to codeguppy.com environment.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35024041,Tell HN: Duolingo (NYSE: DUOL) disrepects your privacy and dislikes questions,2023-03-04T20:10:54Z,PreInternet01,2,false,false,,,,,,"After a mandatory signup for a Duolingo account, <i>anyone</i> using their iPhone and Android (and possibly web) apps can add you as a &#x27;friend&#x27;, without requiring any confirmation from you whatsoever.<p>This is mostly just annoying and might be considered &#x27;typical growth hacking&#x27;, but also constitutes a privacy risk: your &#x27;friends&#x27; are notified whenever you are online, have completed a number of lessons, or whatever. The Duolingo privacy policy (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.duolingo.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;privacy-policy) is obviously a cut-and-paste job (for a NYSE-listed-company, really?) that doesn&#x27;t address concerns like this at all.<p>In the Duolingo app, you get notifications like &#x27;your friends congratulated you on 14 days of being online&#x27; and, more worryingly, &#x27;XXX congratulated you on completing 10 lessons today&#x27;. Nevermind that you don&#x27;t know who XXX is, and can&#x27;t do anything about notifications about your online state being sent to them. Even if you have removed XXX as a &#x27;friend&#x27; from your in-app Duolingo profile aeons ago.<p>So, there is a &#x27;privacy&#x27; option in the Duolingo app. This apparently (again, pretty much without notification, much less consent) requests a ZIP export of all your data (FYI: I&#x27;m in the EU, US experiences may differ). Which takes up to 30 days (Sure, ZIP is not the most efficient file format, but <i>that</i> slow?)<p>But, at least there is an email address: privacy@duolingo.com (pretty much the only contact details you&#x27;ll get as a fully paid up Duolingo customer). Sending a <i>very</i> polite email reply to the minders of this account about the continuous harassment by &#x27;friends&#x27;, however, is a mistake.<p>You will not receive a reply, but your paid Duolingo account will be disabled pretty much immediately. Leaving you, I guess, to sort things out with Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;your credit card company.<p>&#x27;Typical growth hacking&#x27;... Oh, joy...",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
