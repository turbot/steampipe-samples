Besides, LMS tools (which are great for macro-course building) is a bit overkill for what they need, like lead generation, onboarding, micro-learning dripping, and so on. Our solution will generate a full course with a small description, and after a few edits like adding images, quizzes, editing appearance, the course will be ready to share.
