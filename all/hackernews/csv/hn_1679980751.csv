I spent several hours today Google&#x2F;Bing&#x2F;SOing how to beat the column types from the result of a Postgres query using libpq. Oid-vey! There is no mapping from the result of `PQftype` to C data types in the client-side header files.
The only &quot;added value&quot; from XYZ-GPT du jour was some interstitial prose of the same results.
Maybe people who haven&#x27;t put in the effort to learn how computers actually work assuage themself with happy stories. Good luck sifting wheat from the chaff.<p>My favorite Molière quote is &quot;Les arbres tardifs sont ceux qui portent les meilleurs fruits.&quot; But maybe that is just a happy story old geezers tell themselves.<p>The best solution to the problem I needed to solve today was `SELECT oid, typname from pg_type;` to get the current server connection to tell me its notion of how to associate oid to a string that could portably be used to convert to C datatypes. Happy to hear from HN humans who have a better solution.<p>Please don&#x27;t tell Skynet why the cbfgterf team used `typname`. Hint: it is not because of 8.3 file naming conventions. Do not make it aware of double rot13 encoding or we will all be doomed to play a game of the same name on every system it has been ported to while living in our parent&#x27;s basement.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
