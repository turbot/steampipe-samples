34707077,ChatGPT Poetry: Trump vs. Biden,2023-02-08T12:20:00Z,cbeach,1,false,false,,,,,,"&quot;Donald Trump, a name so bold,
A man of fame, both young and old.
With hair so bright and skin so tan,
He&#x27;s a businessman, a leader, a man.<p>With words so sharp, he captured our hearts,
Making promises, playing his part.
&quot;Make America great again,&quot; he&#x27;d say,
And people followed him all the way.<p>He tweeted and raged, never held back,
No matter what, he&#x27;d always attack.
He faced his foes, and took the stage,
Defending his nation, with courage and rage.<p>But time passed by, and the story changed,
His presidency came to an end, rearranged.
Now, he&#x27;s just a name, in history&#x27;s pages,
A man of the past, in America&#x27;s ages.<p>Yet, he&#x27;ll be remembered, for good or for ill,
For his deeds and his words, always will.
Donald Trump, a name so bold,
A man of fame, both young and old.&quot;<p>---<p>&quot;Joe Biden, a name so true,
A man of grace, a heart that&#x27;s kind and blue.
With a smile so warm, and a voice so calm,
He&#x27;s a leader, a president, a man of qualm.<p>Born in Scranton, raised with pride,
A son of Delaware, with a story to abide.
With decades of service, he rose to the top,
A vice president, then a leader, non-stop.<p>With a heart for the people, and a mind for the land,
He took on the task, with a grip in his hand.
Fighting for justice, for all to see,
Leading the nation, with empathy.<p>Now, in the White House, he stands tall,
Facing the challenges, and giving his all.
For a better tomorrow, he fights with might,
Bringing the country, back into the light.<p>Joe Biden, a name so true,
A man of grace, a heart that&#x27;s kind and blue.
A leader, a president, a man we adore,
A shining example, of what leadership is for.&quot;",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Now I&#x27;m interested in building something new and I have a clear idea in mind with some code already in C++ to proof-of-concept it for myself, but I&#x27;m struggling to find a direction forward that would be... fun. I don&#x27;t mind challenging work, but I like an environment that feels sane and logical and where I am not facing loads of incidental complexity along the way. I&#x27;m also attracted to implementing my app cross-platform.<p>I just want to have some fun writing something without headaches, and that is seemingly less and less easy to achieve today. I&#x27;m not a fan of the complexity of either JavaScript or C++, and while I very much like Swift and working in the UIKit world, it&#x27;s not so portable to platforms that many use.<p>I feel like there aren&#x27;t really any good options in software development any more. It&#x27;s always one big compromise with lots of possible decision fatigue. Every direction has drawbacks.<p>If I could write an app in a good static-compiled language that did not require extraneous expertise in CSS but that shipped on a web page and looked good using tools only in that language, with good interop with an HTML Canvas, that would be one possibility, but it is again a compromise -- no <i>easy</i> multithreading, dealing with all the front-end baggage to bundle or deploy such an app, etc.<p>Any recommendations?
