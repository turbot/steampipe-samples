33668165,Elon Has to Destroy Twitter,2022-11-19T08:13:16Z,metaloha,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I wonder if he is destroying Twitter intentionally. No one could make so many bad (stupid, ignorant, mean, etc.) decisions in a row by accident without someone stepping in for the sake of investors. Maybe by bankrupting it he can get out of having to pay anyone back? Could this all just be for the sake of attention?<p>But maybe the math works out - get rid of 80% of the staff (though losing the payroll department seems like a needless complication), risk losing maybe 50% of the advertising, and suddenly there is profit again.<p>Twitter has to be torn down to be rebuilt as a payments system (__Crytter__: Crypto + Twitter) like he seems to want. I think this was a really shitty way to do it. No one with any self-respect is going to work for Twitter for any reason other than money now. Which it doesn&#x27;t have yet.<p>If my non-technical manager asked me for screenshots of &quot;salient code&quot; that I&#x27;ve done and a bullet list of tasks I&#x27;ve completed in the last 6 months so we could have a technical interview, I&#x27;d know deep down in the cockles of my heart that nothing I show them is going to help either of us. They&#x27;re incapable of understanding the technology and I&#x27;m incapable of not rolling my eyes hard enough to make noise. If working unpaid overtime at high levels of performance for an indefinite (but obviously lengthy) period of time is the cost of working for that manager, they can bloody do it themselves while I find a job where I am respected, not bent over and told to bring my own lube. And if these things are a direct result of them alienating and driving off my friends and coworkers with unannounced layoffs and unreasonable demands, then I&#x27;d be doubly sure to get my confident, self-respecting ass out of that martyr&#x27;s chair and find a better opportunity (which will be a very low bar indeed at that point) as quickly as possible. Three months of severance is great (assuming it gets paid - I hate that I have to wonder how many people are going to get screwed out of it) and should be plenty of time to find something enjoyable.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
