She had no friends and was bullied so severely that after multiple schools, we were forced to home-school for most of her teenage years, then through the COVID lockdowns.<p>Social media became an essential part of her life, mainly Instagram.
She worked hard on it for hours every day. She started modelling free collaborative work with photographers. She took the hard path; no bikinis, lingerie or sexualised content. She did this for years and eventually got enough followers to get regular paid modelling work, and at 19, this is now her job, along with singing which we started to help with her confidence.<p>We are unsure how it happened, but after four years, her account has been banned for impersonation. The only thing we can think of was a week ago, she ran into some of the girls who bullied her years ago, and they probably reported her out of spite.<p>There were no warnings, and the remediation process was a form that came back rejected with no ability to try again, even though she has a business registered for the account, driver&#x27;s license and other identification. We have tried everything else, and now she cannot even create a new account, as it is getting banned for spam if she tries contacting her old network.
This is not only her job but her life, her network, and her friends; it&#x27;s all gone.<p>I know these are first-world problems, and it&#x27;s probably stupid to reach out to HN, but it broke my heart to witness the decade of pain she has gone through, every birthday party, not a single friend. 
Now watching her go through this, inconsolable, I am worried she will do something stupid to hurt herself,I am asking for any help.<p>I am looking for any contacts at Meta to see if there is any back channel to try and get her account reinstated or advice on how to move forward.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
