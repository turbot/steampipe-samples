At MariaDB, the answer is no. Each new major version of the software will have its own Change Date.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;Q: What is considered a major version for there to be a new BSL and new Change Date?<p>A: The answer depends on the company providing the BSL software.  At MariaDB, it would be a version that does not only fix bugs but adds features.&quot;<p>It is unclear to me, given those later Q and As, if the first line I quoted is saying 4 years from the release of each version of the code, or the first public release of any of the code.<p>What is the correct way to interpret this?<p>I will likely consult a Lawyer as well if I do go to use this but I figured some people here may already be knowledgeable.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
