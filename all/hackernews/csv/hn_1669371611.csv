[2] Why did the valuations got crushed? For this you need to understand the power of debt!<p>[3] In 2020, due to COVID crash: debt was cheap.<p>- Taking a loan was extremely cheap (no one wanted to hold money)
- Why? Interest rates were extremely low. Why would you want to do a fixed deposit at 4-4.5% rates? (when inflation is 7-8%).<p>[4] You would simply go and risk that money in stocks&#x2F;startups&#x2F;other places.<p>On top of this: due to COVID, many businesses shut shop and many were available at discounts to buy.<p>Almost every big firm, big investor understood this.<p>[5] Therefore, we saw Reliance raising massive capital (why? cheap debt).<p>Startups like BYJU&#x27;s did the same.<p>More acquisitions meant more revenues.
And, a sense of growth.<p>[6] Unfortunately, there is a temporarily halt in cheap credit, in 2022.<p>And, it might take at a year or two for the cheap credit story to revive.<p>People are impatient about growth.<p>More interestingly, they become even more impatient, if there is de-growth.
