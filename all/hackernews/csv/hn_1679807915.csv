What will the world look like?,2023-03-26T04:20:07Z,behnamoh,5,false,false,4,"[35311104,35311052]",,,,"Recent speedy advances in LLMs (ChatGPT → GPT-4 → Plugins, etc.) has been exciting but I can&#x27;t stop thinking about the way our world will be in 10 years. Given the rate of progress in this field, 10 years is actually insanely long time in the future.<p>Will people stop working altogether? Then what do we do with our time? Eat food, sleep, have sex, travel, do creative stuff? In a world when painting, music, literature and poetry, programming, and pretty much all mundane jobs are automated by AI, what would people do? I guess in the short term there will still be demand for manual jobs (plumbers for example), but when robotics finally catches up, those jobs will be automated too.<p>I&#x27;m just excited about a new world era that everyone thought would not happen for another 50-100 years. But at the same time, man I&#x27;m terrified and deeply troubled.<p>And this is just GPT-4. I guess v5, 6, ... will be even more mind blowing. How do you think about these things? I know some people say &quot;incorporate them in your life and work to stay relevant&quot;, but that is only temporary solution. AI will finally be able to handle A-Z of your job. It&#x27;s ironic that the people who are most affected by it are the ones developing it (programmers).",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
