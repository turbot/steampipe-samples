I&#x27;ve been doing so professionally for 7 years. I&#x27;m really good at what I&#x27;m doing and usually clients are really happy with my work. Clients are usually approaching me with nothing but an idea and then we figure out how to make their thing a reality. It works really well usually.<p>However, I&#x27;ve started feeling a bit burned out by the grind recently as I&#x27;m seeing a certain pattern play out more often than I like: For a product to be useful, I usually take roughly 3 months of time. That&#x27;s not the total coding time: But usually within iteration, that&#x27;s the time needed for everybody to really get on the same page with regards to what should be built and to iron out all problems.<p>Then, after these three months we put the product into action online and then that&#x27;s where my resentment originates from probably. I&#x27;m a techy guy, and I work on the bleeding edge, so while many research and development projects truly motivate me to work because its original: When we release the product: usually none of the customers fully get it.<p>By no means is this supposed to be a humble brag: But in terms of technology, I&#x27;m living too far in the future and so the timing of my work is always at least a few months or even years off!<p>However, personally I can add to this drama by saying that I&#x27;d also feel pretty bored to not work on the cutting edge! I usually work with new economic mechanism design and unfamilar math, and this makes my job FUN. But I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m engaged much in the mainstream tech dialog, I&#x27;m more on the fringes.<p>So e.g. working on a product like Twitter on like some arbitrary technical product like maintaining its database just wouldn&#x27;t feel interesting to me: I&#x27;d want to study the algorithm and come up with a better mechanism to rank tweets or something.<p>But I also feel like this is now standing in my way of success as an entrepreneur having all of these skills to build actually nice products. Like I can build really well working products and all: The skills are all there but it seems to be a motivation problem!<p>I want to have success and one thing I&#x27;d like to aim for is that other people are actually using my stuff. E.g. in my last project, I targeted it towards reasonably well-up-to-date developers and I kinda found an audience there for my voice. But at the same time it felt I had outgrown that market pretty fast in that niche.<p>What I&#x27;m striving for is this sense of usage: I want to build a thing that visibly shows how people are using it, I think! I&#x27;m tired of building websites and products that look like they&#x27;re dead. Maybe that&#x27;s what I need to do. Or what do you guys think?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
