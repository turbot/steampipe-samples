Although my basics of html,css are clear, I&#x27;m having trouble in building websites and I&#x27;m just putting baby steps towards it(made my first simple html css site today). Thus a guidance from a mentor would be really helpful to me in learning. If I don&#x27;t find any resources, my plan is to just google and read till I understand.<p>I want to ask this question because I wasted lots of time in the past in bad resources. I bought &quot;CSS Cookbook&quot;, turns out it was heavily outdated. I bought Jonas&#x27;s CSS course in udemy, turns out it wasn&#x27;t right fit for me because it was unnecessarily project heavy. But imo you make projects on your own rather than by watching and copying others make projects.<p>So, recommend me a course that teaches bootstrap basics and maybe guide me towards building a website using html,css and bootstrap. I&#x27;m asking this question so that I don&#x27;t waste more time on bad resources.<p>Should I focus on bootstrap 5 courses or courses teaching any bootstrap are alright?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m now assigned on a project which has a React frontend, and I will be taking over it soon.<p>Now my Javascript knowledge dates back to the days when variables were hoisted (is that still a thing btw?), and URLs started with &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;. Oh, and any time I had to &quot;compile&quot; (???) frontend code I was always shocked about the immaturity of the ecosystem... We had JSP and even JSF, and NodeJS was in its infancy and looked down upon by the &quot;serious&quot; guys. So there is quite a bit of ground to cover.<p>What I would like to have: a few books or courses about modern Javascript, Typescript, browsers, development tools, libraries, that can quickly get me up to speed. For example, on the backend we have this thing called the IO monad - is Javascript still a land of callback hell? Also would appreciate info on React, Angular and Vue (I think these are the most common frameworks?).<p>I&#x27;m also primarily interested in learning the important things. I&#x27;m a quick learner and I don&#x27;t really need stuff that I can easily search for on the net - BUT I do need to know WHAT to search for.<p>What I do NOT need: books on theory, algorithms, books for beginners, books for dummies, books on functional programming, books on &lt;pick your style of programming&gt;, books on web design or color harmonies (no, I will not be designing stuff!)...<p>Why I am asking: I could just start reading books randomly, and it usually takes ages to find out of a 100 books the roughly 10 that are good, and about 1 or 2 that are spectacular. I am looking for those. Thank you. I&#x27;m also happy to pay for online courses, if they are worth it (I still remember Martin Odersky&#x27;s FP&#x2F;Scala course on Coursera from ~10 years ago, which I thought at the time was one of the best, and was worth every minute I spent on it).<p>PS.
