Morale must be thru the floor, and work&#x2F;life balance insane. 
I sincerely wonder why anyone would stay at a place like that. Are the remaining employees True Believers in Elon and his plan? Are they that afraid of the current job market?
Or was there really tons of dead weight at Twitter? With such deep cuts, I&#x27;d have expected even more serious outages than what we&#x27;ve seen so far.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34800794,Ask HN: Why did anti-FOSS move by GrapheneOS not receive more attention?,2023-02-15T06:40:02Z,throwaway_graph,3,false,false,,,,,,"Throwaway because I don&#x27;t want to be &quot;ousted&quot; from the privacy&#x2F;security community for saying something negative about GrapheneOS [0]. I&#x27;m a big fan of the project but unfortunately it has formed a cult-like community that unquestionably goes along with every move that the project and its administration makes. I think it&#x27;s important to always be critical, even of things you like, because this is the only way things can improve.<p>As some basic background: GrapheneOS is a FOSS Android fork aiming to improve privacy and security. CalxyOS is another such project. Strangely there has been a long history of drama between GrapheneOS and CalyxOS, despite both sharing similar goals. I won&#x27;t get into it here because it&#x27;s not relevant or very interesting. The gist of it is: the GrapheneOS and CalyxOS projects&#x2F;communities don&#x27;t get along very well.<p>Recently there was a controversy where the founder of GrapheneOS told the Bromite project (another FOSS project I&#x27;m a fan of) that they could no longer use any GrapheneOS code simply because they were planning to accept a <i>single contribution</i> from a CalyxOS project member. The Bromite developer responding to the PR didn&#x27;t even know the person who opened it was involved with CalyxOS and was unaware of any animosity towards CalyxOS on the GrapheneOS side. I understand refusing to work directly with members of a community you despise, but this is blatantly ridiculous. The GrapheneOS project is setting a standard where, if you associate with any members of any &quot;blacklisted&quot; projects in any way, you are at risk of being cast out of the GrapheneOS community and denied access to GrapheneOS code. This is completely against the nature of free and open source software.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;bromite&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2141<p>This obviously attracted attention in lots of places, but notably not on HN for some reason [1], despite GrapheneOS being a popular topic here [2].<p>In general I&#x27;m no fan of drama, but I think this reflects poorly on the GrapheneOS project and I think all GrapheneOS users should be aware of it.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31769696<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?q=grapheneos",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
