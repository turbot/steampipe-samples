35079275,Show HN: Dixit – Semantic search from quotation database,2023-03-09T08:15:45Z,aubanel,1,false,false,,,,,,"[LLM-based semantic search meets historical quotes]
Hello HN,<p>Want to sound smart, impress a date, get the right quotation to introduce this essay? Dixit lets you type an idea, and searches for historical quotations that roughly convey the the same idea, but probably in a cooler formulation + with the authority stamp of someone who has a Wikipedia page.<p>I built it over the 3 last weekends (and a few nights). It was quite fun! Dixit uses 25,000 quotations, a light language model from HuggingFace hub, Django, Railway server, and some CSS animations that I find cool. The code is available at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;A-Roucher&#x2F;dixit"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;A-Roucher&#x2F;dixit</a>.<p>Next thing I&#x27;ll do is keep improving the database to remove some quotes and add many more. Please don&#x27;t hesitate to propose improvements!",story,https://dixit.app/searchbar/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Also needness to &quot;verify&quot; is the email active might be very annoying for user, especially for that one who is not OK to store cookies. Why Internets are so bureaucratic nowadays? I remember the time when all I need was to verify e-mail only once for absolutely every website (twitter, fb, every mail provider, etc).<p>Why everybody stopped think that phone might be lost or currently not functioning, e-mail might been banned or temporarily not available because of currently not functioning phone, etc. The worst part of status-quo is that this annoyances were started after Bitcoin showed us a perfect login system with totally single factor. It can be working either for human or for cat or for AI, you get the idea.<p>What kind of evil joke is the second factor auth, why nobody learns anything from Bitcoin way?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

35079262,"Stripe – Pricing changes for US businesses starting June 1, 2023",2023-03-09T08:13:52Z,wonderingyogi,3,false,false,,,,,,"Hello,<p>We’re letting you know about Stripe pricing changes for international card transactions, disputes, and sales tax, starting June 1, 2023. We also want to share ways we can help you reduce costs and grow revenue.<p>International card transactions<p>Over the past few years, card networks have increased the total fees that Stripe pays for card processing. Because of these costs, starting June 1, Stripe’s additional fee for international card transactions will change from 1.0% to 1.5%. There’s no change to our standard 2.9% + $0.30 pricing for US card transactions.<p>How you can reduce costs and grow globally:<p>In many countries, customers prefer to pay with their bank, digital wallet, or other non-card methods, which may be cheaper than cards. Stripe makes it easy for you to accept more than 25+ ways to pay using Checkout, the Payment Element, or with the API, and you can choose the most effective payment methods for your business.<p>Our checkout experiences automatically show your customers the most relevant payment methods based on local preferences and are tailored to 30+ languages and 135+ currencies across web and mobile.<p>Disputes<p>Whether you win or lose a dispute, card networks charge Stripe a fee in either case. To cover these costs, starting June 1, Stripe will no longer return the $15 dispute fee for successfully contested disputes. The dispute fee itself is not changing.<p>How you can prevent chargebacks and win more disputes:<p>Stripe Radar uses machine learning to help prevent fraudulent charges. Radar is typically a paid product, but it’s free for users like you on our standard pricing.<p>We now recommend what to submit by analyzing millions of disputes, so you can fight the right ones with the best evidence.<p>Making payment optimization features free<p>We’ve decided to make two payment optimization features free for you starting June 1. Adaptive Acceptance and network tokens have increased revenue for businesses on Stripe by an average of 1.2%. There’s nothing you need to do: we’ll turn them on for your account if they aren’t on already.<p>Adaptive Acceptance prevents customer card declines using machine learning to dynamically optimize the details of card network requests. In 2022, Adaptive Acceptance generated over $5 billion of incremental revenue for Stripe businesses.<p>Network tokens automatically update card details when old cards expire so your customers don’t need to re-enter anything.<p>We’re here to help you navigate these price changes and grow your business.
