34876086,Ask HN: How can employees protect themselves against expiring equity?,2023-02-21T03:23:47Z,arkadiyt,3,false,false,,,,,,"It seems like there&#x27;s a trend for companies to stay private longer and longer. Double trigger RSUs can&#x27;t be granted with an expiration longer than 7 years, and options can&#x27;t be granted with an exercise time longer than 10 years after leaving the company (Zach Holman keeps a handy list of companies granting 10 year exercise windows here [1]).<p>So where does that leave employees? It feels like the calculus on joining early stage startups doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile anymore - before you were lucky if you had a liquidity event at all, now you have that plus if it happens at all it&#x27;s very likely after your shares have expired and the company has no obligation to renew them or make you whole.<p>Is there anything prospective employees can do to protect themselves? Just join later stage &#x2F; public companies?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;holman&#x2F;extended-exercise-windows",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I love doing research and publish a few papers every year where I am the first author.<p>I recently received a large raise which makes securing funding a bit difficult.  My grant money doesn&#x27;t go as far which means I dont have as much time to spend on each problem.  Essentially, I must find another grant to keep myself funded.  I hate this.<p>I have asked HR to lower my salary but they refused.  They said I can charge overhead if I am short on money but I think this is a bad long-term solution especially as layoffs are in swing.<p>It seems that with my skillset, I am no longer encouraged to work on research, but to help supervise several projects simultaneously to help younger folks with their research. I have experience with this and its quite rewarding but the younger folks simply dont have the math chops to create the robust solutions I have been able make throughout my career.  I usually have one &quot;brilliant&quot; idea a year which leads to a big breakthrough hence my salary raise.  This has only come about because I allocate larges amounts of time to sit and reflect on a problem. But, with having to manage more projects to stay funded, I no longer have the ability to work within such an environment.  I have to believe I am simply at the wrong organization and that someone will hire me.<p>I am 39 with a PhD.  I feel way to young to give up on research yet!

With so many products available online, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to differentiate between genuine and fake reviews. Amazon and other e-commerce platforms are full of fake reviews that can mislead consumers into buying substandard products. This means that consumers can end up wasting their time and money on products that don&#x27;t meet their needs, and this problem is only getting worse. Styrate solves this problem by connecting consumers with trusted influencers who provide honest reviews and recommendations.<p>With video reviews, upvoting, and sorting&#x2F;search by type of product, users can easily discover the most highly rated reviews for their needs. Fake reviews cost Americans 0.12 cents on every dollar they spend online, making it crucial to have a platform like Styrate for informed purchasing decisions. The MVP is a little rough around the edges and is missing a few pages(top influencers, Product Categories,etc) and the ability to search by product.
