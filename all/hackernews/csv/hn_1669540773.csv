I didn&#x27;t get a screenshot of this tool or script, and I cannot find it on Github with my poor searching.<p>I wanted to ask HN:<p>1) What is your routine to monitor for viruses&#x2F;malware on your (desktop) Linux machines?
2) How do you stay aware of major CVEs and supply chain attacks?
3) I&#x27;m used to ClamAV, are there any polished GUIs for some of these antivirus scanners to make monitoring more informative&#x2F;user friendly?
4) Know of any distro or package-manager specific tools for identifying malware?  I recently got back into nodejs and I&#x27;m happy to see npm warning of insecurities.
5) Anyone know the Secure Boot &quot;checker&quot; I&#x27;m talking about above?
6) Anyone using several antivirus solutions together in a way that is efficient&#x2F;smartly configured?  (the thought of 2 daemons scanning all my files circularly doesn&#x27;t seem fantastic)
7) Bonus points for mentioning Little Snitch-like daemons to block telemetry.  I&#x27;m curious if anyone is using machine learning to identify patterns from software trying to phone-home vs normal operation.  I understand the argument:  If you can&#x27;t trust what you&#x27;re running locally, all is lost.<p>Thank you",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

33761553,Ask HN: Can you argue public/open-source code is publically funded/subsidized?,2022-11-27T09:02:37Z,thrwawy74,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have a tenuous argument in my head.  Several years ago &quot;The Social Contract&quot; was talked about in political circles.  The basic idea being that if you&#x27;re a successful business you owe some portion of your success to the city you&#x27;re based out of being clean, devoid of crime, regulated, etc.  If you want to operate a business in this space, you must adhere to its rules and you may prosper because of its protections.<p>So here&#x27;s what would be a very flawed argument:  Can you say those contributing code to the public domain with open licenses were publically funded works?  That the society which allowed them to create and contribute freely essentially funded or subsidized that development?<p>The objective would be to protect free and open-source software as publically funded works, whether the author has the resources to defend the work from other companies are not.  Could you protect it as a third-party?<p>If this were true, you could compel companies to open software they&#x27;ve created derived from public works.  The hideous other side of the coin is that countries could establish ownership rights over software created within their &quot;borders&quot;.
