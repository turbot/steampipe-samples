33823539,Ask HN: How to leave academia? And where to go?,2022-12-01T22:01:21Z,low_tech_love,2,false,false,2,[33823686],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m an associate professor in Computer Science at an European university. It&#x27;s a &quot;tenured&quot;, safe, permanent, and comfortable position. My salary is slightly above average, I have a mortgage on a beautiful new house, my working hours are very flexible, and I virtually have no boss. And I hate my job.<p>The main reason is that I spend most of my time dealing with relationships with other people. My working place is very horizontal, which means everyone wants everything all the time; every snowflake wants to shine, and every flower wants to have the best smell. That&#x27;d be ok if I could simply ignore them, but since we have virtually no hierarchy, that means that (a) we need to have meetings all the time, where nothing gets solved (because there is no one to make final decisions), and (b) we&#x27;re supposed to solve everything peer-to-peer, which means people will keep knocking on your door all the time: there is always a new idea, a new project, a new complaint, a new possibility, someone needs to cover for someone else, etc. I like to be engaged in my work, I mean, I want to be active in whatever I do, so there is a tendency for things to fall on my lap and never leave it. I need to keep fighting and pushing back constantly in order to do a minimum amount of significant and relevant work. It&#x27;s exhausting.<p>I would like to leave academia and work in a company, where people are still people but they have some common, objective, external constraints and goals (like making money and&#x2F;or making the company grow). In academia, there is no goal other than building your own personal individual career. Since we have no real boss and virtually no external assessment whatsoever, everything invariably ends up moving towards whoever has the larger ego, i.e. the ones who are louder and sound more certain of themselves and whatever they are doing. These are usually the ones who can get other people to do some part of their job, so they can go and  be even louder and get even more people to do their job, and so on.<p>I don&#x27;t mean by this that I don&#x27;t want to work with other people; exactly the opposite. I love to work with people, as long as, by the end of the day, someone says &quot;ok, we got a few different opinions, but we&#x27;re moving this way. Let&#x27;s do this.&quot; It may work or not, but at least there is something else to pursue other than pure egotism supported by non-existent or informal notions of grandeur.<p>So, how can anyone make such a transition? Any experiences out there? Any success&#x2F;failure stories?
I am <i>very good</i> at programming basically anything, I&#x27;m just a bit rusty. If I can sit in front of an IDE and code for 4 hours straight you&#x27;ll see a man with a smile (I might even consider a low entry salary). Right now my twisted idea of paradise is having a boss who says &quot;code this&quot;, instead of only coding my own personal projects (and failing miserably to reach my ridiculously over-inflated expectations for them).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

33822950,Show HN: A Japanese learning app focused on efficient vocab/grammar acquisition,2022-12-01T21:21:00Z,chrisvasselli,2,false,false,2,[33823194],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN, it’s been 8 years since I posted on here about the launch of my Japanese dictionary app Nihongo [0] and I’m finally back with a new app: Nihongo Lessons!<p>Think of Nihongo Lessons as the textbook to Nihongo’s dictionary. It’s an app for learning Japanese, specifically made for learners who are serious about becoming fluent, and want a guided set of content that will help them efficiently acquire vocabulary and grammar.<p>The project came about when Adam Shapiro of Japanese Level Up (Jalup) [1] announced last April that he was shutting Jalup down. As a fan of Adam’s work I was bummed to hear the news, but realized I actually might be one of the few people in the world in a position to keep his work alive. So I reached out, and we came up with a deal where I would sell Jalup content in my apps.<p>Originally it was envisioned as an add-on to Nihongo, but after starting to build this out it became clear that from a UX perspective it felt too bloated and tacked-on to just shove Jalup into Nihongo. Plus, given that Jalup is built around one-time content purchases, and Nihongo is a subscription, the purchases involved would feel convoluted, and people might be upset that they weren’t included in the Nihongo subscription.<p>So, I started building a separate app that would become Nihongo Lessons. From a technical perspective, Nihongo Lessons is actually just a different entry point into essentially the same app bundle as Nihongo. This gives me a lot of the infrastructure (sync, error reporting, screenshot generation, etc.) of Nihongo for free, and makes it easy to share UI, which I do a fair amount of (flashcards, tutorials, settings). Everything that actually changes behavior between the apps is stored in a single file as an “app variant” configuration, so if I decide to create another companion app in the future, it should be even easier.<p>It’s iPhone-only for now, but iPad will be coming soon. No plans for an Android release at the moment.<p>Download: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1640204242"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1640204242</a><p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10094326"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10094326</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;japaneselevelup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;japaneselevelup.com</a>",story,https://lessons.nihongo-app.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
