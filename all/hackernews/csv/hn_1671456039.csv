I haven&#x27;t been to the eye doctor since, but at that point my vision was around 20&#x2F;20 or slightly impaired. I did get glasses, which I rarely wear, but I have been wearing them more recently because I feel that my eyesight may be becoming more of an issue. For example, after long periods of coding or looking at my phone screen, I see floaters. Sometimes I wake up seeing them and have a low-productivity day or take a nap and some Advil in the hope that it is related to a migraine.<p>I am mainly interested in what tools, settings, and themes people with astigmatism use, and if you have any preference for light or dark themes. Personally, I cannot stand light, whether it is physical light or light on screens. When my 5-year-old turns on the overhead light in my bedroom, I pull the blanket over my head or shout to turn it off. I feel like Gizmo from Gremlins.<p>I am a developer, and my main tools are Terminator + Tmux, Chrome, DBeaver, and Visual Studio Code. The font I am using is Jetbrains SemiBold. I just tried the Solarized Dark theme and I am kind of liking it, but I feel like I might be able to find something slightly better. Before that, I have used Night Owl, GitHub Dark, Material, and a few others.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
