35089651,Feature Flags Best Practice – Overview,2023-03-10T02:20:35Z,hu-beau,2,false,false,,,,,,"This post presents the overview of feature flags best practice, it will introduce feature flags technology step by step:<p>1. What the Feature Flag is.
2. How engineers use feature flag technology.
3. How Feature Flags evolve into Feature Management.
4. How Feature Management helps product and business teams.
5. Using the lifecycle to represent feature flags throughout dev to business.<p>## What&#x27;s Feature Flag<p>Feature flag is a modern engineering technology that decouples code deployments from feature releases, giving you control over who sees each feature and when they see it.<p>## What a feature flag looks like<p>```
if(flags.newFeatureA == true){
  runNewFeatureA();
}<p>```<p>Feature flags, in their simplest form, are just if conditions in your code check whether a certain feature is enabled. This allows us to deploy features even when they are not ready, meaning that our codebase is always deployable. This, in turn, enables continuous deployment even while the team is continuously pushing small commits to the main branch.<p>## How engineering teams use feature flags<p>Feature flags help engineering teams to:<p>1. Reduce delivery risk and deployment stress. Perform Testing in Production, Targeted rollouts&#x2F;release progressions before rolling out the feature to all users.
2. Accelerate feature releases. Decouple deployments from releases, decouple features from the entire application package, and follow trunk-based development.
3. Enable experimental feature development.
4. Faster incident resolution. Automatically disable buggy features when key service metrics exceed a certain threshold in your APM tool.
5. Maintain high stability. Progressively migrate from a monolith to microservices, switch to a new database, and migrate infrastructure to the cloud.<p>## What&#x27;s Feature Management<p>Feature management is a new class of software development tools and techniques rooted in feature flags. It provides a holistic framework for feature flag-driven development, A&#x2F;B testing, and experimentation, enabling teams to use flags on a massive scale across a variety of use cases.<p>## How Feature Management empowers product and business<p>Feature management empowers all teams to deliver, control, experiment with, and monetize their software:<p>- Help product managers to improve user experience by measuring the impact of features’ rollouts, and running A&#x2F;B tests to improve feature quality.
- Enable the Customer Success team to close more deals with live demos and feature trials at the push of a button. Help Support debug exactly which features and tests a customer has for faster resolution.
- Give Marketing and Design the ability to fine-tune target audiences, coordinate announcements, and manage special customer programs.
- Empower finance teams quickly get the billing report of how customers used and paid for the different features and subscriptions.<p>## Categories and Lifecycle of Feature Flags<p>Feature Flag service covers the entire process from developing to delivering to customer success.<p>[Picture] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.featbit.co&#x2F;images&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;bestpractice&#x2F;feature-flag-life-cycle-categories.png<p>Four categories of Feature Flag are presented in the whole lifecycle: Release, Experiment, Ops, and Permission. One feature flag can be destroyed immediately after the Release phase. It can also be kept until the end. It all depends on how your team uses it.<p>Here&#x27;s a diagram that makes it easy to understand the lifecycle of Feature Flags.<p>[Picture] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.featbit.co&#x2F;images&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;bestpractice&#x2F;feature-flag-lifecycle-process.png<p>## Conclusion<p>Feature flags management empowers all teams to deliver, control, experiment with, and monetize their software. FeatBit&#x27;s customers say the Feature Flags Management Service bridges the gap between engineering teams and the business.<p>Original article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.featbit.co&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;Feature-Flags-Best-Practice-I-Overview",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
35089698,Phone verification is ransomware for your privacy,2023-03-10T02:27:29Z,fukouda,3,false,false,,,,,,"Story for a context (skip to last paragraph for actual question)<p>So, imagine you&#x27;ve got yourself Discord account used semi-actively for over 5 years and one day you are locked out of it, because you decided to send a friend request to someone you have DM history spanning over years, since you no longer had any shared servers.           
First thing you are asked, when adding a friend is to confirm your email(?) - which, ironically, it asked you just a while ago to check inbox of, in order to confirm login from different IP (I guess these days your IP number is your SSN and never changes, understandable), so not entirely sure what Discord is trying to accomplish here (for reference email in question has been confirmed a looong time ago and not changed for multiple years by now). Fine, maybe somehow it got automatically marked as stale, for &quot;security reasons&quot;, even though it was fine just a second ago to get past login screen..
Okay, after doing that and like 20 captchas about basketball, since completing at least 5 in a row each time is considered minimum to prove one&#x27;s humanity (or you know, do captcha too fast, you are a bot, good luck on another ten) and basically training some AI botnet for free, you return to friend list tab, and what you see - &quot;Something&#x27;s Going on here&quot;, now if you could kindly provide us with your phone number and maybe, just maybe, if your phone number was part of our favourite country whitelist, we will let you back in, else - you know, that day you decided to press add to friends button - that was a huge mistake.           
Solution (pretty much citing discord support stance) - please, create new account(?), rinse and repeat, since we would rather choke on our own shit, than unlock an account if we couldn&#x27;t pinpoint your position down to the coach.<p>This and many other stories is what happens to me over and over in span of last years.
Their &quot;abuse&quot; filters feel so trigger happy that I&#x27;ve seen this happening, when joining a server from public link (mind you server without phone verification) or doing basically any random thing that itself is in no way considered an abuse.<p>I&#x27;m putting discord on the spot here, but truth is almost all &quot;popular&quot; services do this, like they know that they are invisible by now and will probably get whatever they feel like getting at that particular day (from most). 
At this point I feel like actual ransomware being less invasive, since criminals at least have sense of decency to not ask for a phone number.<p>Question, I wander why is it even legal for all these services to just lock you effectively out of all your data (I&#x27;m sure there is a nice way to deflect this statement as well, by saying that all my messages are property of service provider or something along these lines) at no time notice, making situation pretty much mental ransomware - pay us with your personal data or be locked of what we kept. I understand any company is allowed to refuse providing their services at any time, but at this point is there really nothing law-wise stopping them from requiring your bank number next, since you know - noone is being forced to do anything, you can just not provide that data and stay locked forever, right.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
