35369983,Show HN: Open-Source Webhooks Gateway for Platform Engineers,2023-03-30T09:11:39Z,rtukpe,3,false,false,,,,,,"Hey Friends,<p>We&#x27;re excited to be launching Convoy on HN. Convoy is an open-source webhooks gateway. Webhooks continue to be hard at scale, and large teams require consistent tooling for inbound &amp; outbound webhooks. Convoy enables developers to securely send, receive and manage millions of webhooks reliably with features like retries, rate limiting, circuit breaking, customer-facing webhook logs, zero downtime secrets rotation and more.<p>Since our initial launch [0], we&#x27;ve learned a lot about our users and made several important improvements we are excited to share:<p>- We are now a webhooks gateway! Akin to API Gateways that sit at the edge of your network to receive all API traffic and route them to the respective microservice, webhooks gateways sit at the edge of your network to receive webhooks from any backend service and route to client endpoints as well as ingest events from multiple providers and route them to the required backend services.<p>- We now have first-class integration with Pub&#x2F;Sub Systems. Our users wanted increased deliverability guarantees. Your backend services write events to a queue&#x2F;topic etc. Convoy consumes the queues, creates webhook events and dispatches those reliably to client endpoints. We currently support Amazon SQS and Google PubSub. On our roadmap, we have the following planned - Kafka, RabbitMQ &amp; Nats (In that order)<p>- We switched our backend store to PostgreSQL. This improves the self-hosted experience tremendously. MongoDB was great for storing schemaless data, but was severely lacking in some important features for our users, e.g. transactions don&#x27;t work on a single node; you need to bootstrap a replica set; also, we wanted to ship updates frequently, but the lack of migrations for schema &amp; data changes slowed us down.<p>- We decided to go the open-core route of OSS monetisation because it offered us a good balance to serve our community and make enough money to run the company. Like GitLab, we hope to be good stewards of our community edition. Since our enterprise edition is simply a wrapper around the community edition with enterprise features like RBAC, Audit Logs etc., we are properly incentivised to continue making it excellent.<p>- Our Cloud platform is in the private alpha stage. Please contact us at founders@getconvoy.io to gain access!<p>Our mission is to serve hobbyist developers all the way to the most ambitious teams on the planet with a consistent and easy-to-use webhooks gateway for asynchronous communication on the internet.<p>We welcome you to try it out using our getting started at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;frain-dev&#x2F;convoy#installation-getting-started"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;frain-dev&#x2F;convoy#installation-getting-sta...</a>.

I&#x27;m wondering how can I make this secure. There are a couple of security flaws that I could think of:<p>- cloning a huge repository will take a long time (how can I check the repository size?)<p>- cloning a couple of repositories at the same time might make the server slow<p>- running shell commands on the actual system might be dangerous<p>First thing I thought of was running these git commands in Docker. But I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s applicable since everything will be running inside Docker anyways. What would be the best way of doing this?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
