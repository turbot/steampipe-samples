34851006,Ask HN: Interested in Creating a Series of Analysis Videos on Startups,2023-02-18T20:57:40Z,wwwpatdelcom,1,false,false,,,,,,"I&#x27;m interested in creating a series of snapshot analysis videos on small startups either leveraging A.I. API&#x27;s such as OpenAI&#x27;s Davinci, or various AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;Google Cloud tools, or startups that have created their own transformer&#x2F;ML tech and running it straight on the cloud. That being said, I am not sure how to make this interesting or engaging, e.g. entertaining through the YouTube&#x2F;Video medium.<p>I really would like to go through and analyze about 25 startups, in video form, I&#x27;m going to do it whether I can actually make the videos interesting or not...but, I would love anyone&#x27;s thoughts on how I can actually improve these videos and make them interesting.<p>Here&#x27;s my pilot episode. I have no affiliation with the startup analyzed, Eightify, I just found them on HN and thought it was interesting:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1t94qkviuZg<p>One thing I definitely plan on doing is making future videos between 5-10 minutes long rather than 15.<p>Please ping me if you know of another startup&#x2F;small AI&#x2F;ML company which you would like analyzed. I will not do promotion and need to stay distant from whatever startup video I create, so please provide a link and no other info (otherwise I won&#x27;t do a video on whatever you send). We can always talk after I create a video on that topic if you would like, but I would like these to all be as, &quot;blind&quot; as possible.<p>Thank you all in advance.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
