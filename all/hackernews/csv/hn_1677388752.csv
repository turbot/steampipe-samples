34943078,Ask HN: Is language or paradigm important while learning to program?,2023-02-26T04:39:42Z,optbuild,3,false,false,1,[34943241],,,,"Some say that language doesn&#x27;t matter while learning to program for the first time. It is the principles that matter.<p>Others say functional paradigm should be taught first before imperative to make code less error prone.<p>Some others suggest that we should focus on data and its structure more and learn coding based on the data we are operating on. So pick a project to solve.<p>And then there are language suggestors like do Python, or Javascript, or Scheme, etc, etc.<p>But do these really have any importance or is any place good to start?<p>Does it depend upon a person&#x27;s age?<p>I know there are many people on HN who started in the era of green and black terminals with assembly or very low level languages. But if someone decides to start today, what would be the best choice?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
